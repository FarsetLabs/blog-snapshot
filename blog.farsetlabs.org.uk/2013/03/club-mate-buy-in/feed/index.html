					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2013/03/club-mate-buy-in/#comment-740&quot;&gt;H.Van der Ross&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, it worked very well, we ended up ordering over 200l of Club Mate (which contained enough caffiene to kill one of our directors 2.6 times!).

We actually had to put in ANOTHER order last week and recieved it yesterday, so it&#039;s well worth it. 

For the trip from Germany to South Africa, I can imagine you&#039;ll need higher prices to make it viable, but if you take the time to take orders (pay on order always helps too) it&#039;s not difficult at all :D.

Good luck]]></description>
