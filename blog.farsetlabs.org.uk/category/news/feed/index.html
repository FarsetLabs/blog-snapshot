<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other News While We’ve Been in Lockdown</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/FarsetLabs/status/1246124950282481666">We have lent our new Lulzbot Mini 3D printer to Axial3D</a> for their PPE manufacturing project, providing first responders and medical staff with near-medical-grade safety equipment to combat Coronavirus.</li><li>Our <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/241330">Folding@Home team</a> burned a lot of CPU-cycles to contribute to COVID19 Research, currently ranked in the top 2% of teams in the world.</li><li>New <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/288">CCTV policy</a> in place along with ICO registration that clarifies that CCTV is only to be used for security and compliance with law enforcement and no other purpose (along with a 30 day retention period)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/FarsetLabs/status/1273636588074000385">#BreakfastClub</a> has been operating 6 days a week since March, with members meeting up via Discord to catch up about their days and share.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23infosecni&amp;src=typed_query">#InfoSecNI</a>, a professional practice network of cybersecurity workers, has been running semi-regular movie nights and tweet-alongs, with Hackers, Sneakers, and WarGames all being shown (And critiqued!).

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Guidelines</h1>



<p><em>Published both here and at </em><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy"><em>https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy</em></a><em> for completeness</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purpose</h2>



<p>The purpose of these guidelines is to set out the procedures and restrictions that are put in place to allow Farset Labs to open in a safe manner during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</p>



<p>These temporary guidelines will remain under constant review, with particular respect to any changes in government guidelines or restrictions. Should any subsequent government policy contradict any aspect of these guidelines it will be expected that Farset Labs and it’s members will immediately comply with government policy.</p>



<p>In issuing these guidelines the Labs trustees acknowledge that it may be necessary to close the building again at short notice in response to future government directives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organisational Named Person For COVID-19 Response</h2>



<p>Best practices dictate that organisations should have a named person responsible for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>As such, Art Knipe will be responsible for these guidelines, will be the contact person for questions regarding our response to COVID-19 and will be responsible for organisational contact tracing in the event of a member reporting an infection. (art@farsetlabs.org.uk).</p>



<p>Should Art be unable to fulfil this role for any reason Colin Mitchell will deputise (colin.mitchell@farsetlabs.org.uk)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Guidelines for Reopening of Farset Labs</h2>



<p>Farset Labs will begin a phased reopening on 24/06/20 at 10am. The reopening will proceed based on the following guidance:</p>



<ul><li>Upon reopening we will request that our members continue to work from home if they can, in line with the<a href="https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf"> guidance from the NI Executive</a>.</li><li>Access to the building will be subject to these new guidelines.</li><li>It will be left to the discretion and good sense of individual members to decide whether they can continue to work from home or need to use the space.</li><li>All members will be required to complete and sign an online Pre-Return form which indicates their agreement with these guidelines. This must be done before they can return to the space.</li></ul>



<p>If you wish to return to the space at this time, you must contact Art Knipe by email (art@farsetlabs.org.uk) to notify him of your intention to return. You will then be asked to fill in a Pre-Return Disclaimer, after which you will be given new access control codes.</p>



<p><strong>Do not return to the space if you have not already digitally signed the pre-return disclaimer as you will not be permitted in the building</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Guidelines For Access To Farset Labs During Ongoing COVID-19 Restrictions</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to the #COVID19 pandemic, Farset Labs has made the following decisions.</p>



<ol><li>We are <strong>no longer hosting any public events</strong> as part of Farset Labs programmes (CoderDojo, ELi5, DataArt, etc)</li><li>All Meetings (Town Hall, Management, Trustees) will be <strong>remote</strong>.</li><li>It is recommended that external/community hires of the space also suspend, but events will over all be restricted to <strong>less than 15</strong> participants.</li><li>It is recommended that <strong>no more than 15 people</strong> are in the building at any one time</li><li>The facility will <strong>continue to be open</strong> to those who wish to use it, following reasonable precautions outlined below.</li><li>Private Meetings can still take place on site if <strong>reasonable precautions</strong> are enforced.</li><li><strong>Do not visit if you are symptomatic</strong> (continuous cough or high temperature).</li><li>If you develop symptoms and have visited the space in the previous 10 days, <strong>please notify us</strong> on <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></li><li><strong>Hand Sanitiser and Soap</strong> will become available throughout the building. </li><li>Facilities are being made available for event organisers to <strong>stream presentations </strong>to support sustaining their own communities online free of charge.</li></ol>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Provision of Streaming Facilities for Event Operators</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last week, we set up a<a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/event-space-streaming-av-setup/26"> two-camera streaming capability</a> in the event space. This capability is being made available to all event organisers; members or otherwise, for the purposes of hosting online events with presenters. We’re currently awaiting delivery of an HDMI capture device to include higher resolution of projected screen contents, but if you’d like to take advantage of this facility, please get in touch on <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Reasonable Precautions&nbsp;</h1>



<p>(As per <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS </a>and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">WHO</a> Advice)</p>



<ul><li>Wash hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds with hot water and soap.</li><li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.</li><li>Stay at home if you’ve got coronavirus symptoms.<ul><li>New, continuous cough.</li><li>High temperature above 37.5 degrees celsius.</li></ul></li><li>Advise social distancing for visitors and members.</li></ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Closing comments</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">There’s a lot of these statements going around, and it is a time of lots of news and statistics and a mix between panic and complacency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very high likelihood that we’ll have to shut the facility down completely in the coming weeks. Fortunately, we’re kinda used to that over the past year! If that’s the case we’ll be communicating both openly and privately with members to facilitate safely removing anything they might need from the space while instituting a full “lockdown”.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">In times like this, the physical building of Farset Labs is less important than the community; <strong>social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation</strong>. Whether you’re a member or not, stay connected on our <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Slack</a>, Share stuff that you think is cool on our <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Discourse</a>, and when open meetings come up, please dial in just to chill out.</p>



<p>Stay nerdy my friends.<br />the Farset Labs team</p>

<p><a href="https://dataartni.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art Northern Ireland</a> is a community of technologists, artists, policy makers and other creatives that regularly come together to show, tell and learn about the collision of Data and Art.</p>



<p>Learn about visualisation techniques, data aggregation, and where to get data sources to create, inform, and excite.</p>



<p>If you want to get involved, join our Meetup Group to be first to hear when we release our schedule of events.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meetups </h2>



<p><a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> is running meetups across Northern Ireland to bring the tech, creative, and public policy sectors together, so share their successes, failures, experiments and experiences, in order to build a shared understanding of how we can make the world, if not a better place, at least a more informed one!</p>



<p>Data Art has been operating as a community-run <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast">meetup group</a> since 2017, mostly based in <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs, Belfast</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to the support of the <a href="https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/open-data-ni-innovation-and-outreach-fund">Department of Finances OpenDataNI Advocacy fund</a>, we are taking the show on the road!</p>



<p>Venues and partners we plan on working with include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.vaultartiststudios.com/">Vault Artist Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalartsstudios.com/">Digital Arts Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/projects/immersive-labs/">Digital Catapult Immersive Labs, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bpw.org.uk/">Belfast Print Workshop, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thehubnewry.com/">The Hub, Newry</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre, Derry</a></li></ul>



<p>If you’d like to host <a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> in your venue, please get in touch with us at dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>



<p>(Also if you’d like to collaborate on running a local chapter of DataArt in your area…)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Workshops</h2>



<p>Meetups are only part of the puzzle; we need to learn how to handle the different facets of “Data Art”, and that takes more than a cursory presentation…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs</a> are hosting a series of technical and creative workshops to upskill technologists, creatives, and passionate amateurs in targeted capabilities to enable the acquisition, exploration, augmentation, and visualisation of data in one way or another.</p>



<p>This could (depending on interest displayed) include sessions on topics such as:</p>



<ul><li>Programming for Data Analysis</li><li>Embedded IoT for sensor acquisition and data visualisation</li><li>Machine Learning and Statistics</li><li>Geospatial Techniques and Analysis</li><li>Real-time Visualisation and Sonification</li><li>Typography and Graphic Design Fundamentals</li><li>Colour Theory and Interactive Visual Arts Design</li><li>3D Design / Game Development</li><li>Physical Programming (aka Knitting and Crocheting)</li></ul>



<p>But we want to listen to you! And we’ll be planning out the workshops with partners based on feedback received from the Meetups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hackathons</h2>



<p>Over the past years, Hackathons have become the ‘de-rigueur’ way of engaging with the technology community to showcase some technology, problem, or task to be crowdsourced or socialised, usually in exchange for an .</p>



<p>Rather than running a big, high end, one-off, 24 hour crunch-time hackathon, we are running a quarterly series of hackathons instead, all with the thread around the cleaning, use, analysis and ‘artification’ of open data to inform and excite.</p>



<p>This provides time to really understand processes, projects and experiments, and also for relevant data owners in local government to be able to react and engage with the data-user community through platforms like <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/">OpenDataNI</a>, and provide space to get real projects off the ground and make real change in our communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Open Data Innovation and Outreach Fund</strong></h2>



<p>We&#8217;re not the only ones being supported in this programme; Seven projects from Belfast, Derry and Newry have been successful from the £30,000 fund which encourages innovation in the reuse of data on the <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Data NI portal</a>.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.allstate.com/northern-ireland/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Allstate Northern Ireland</a> was awarded £2,500 in partnership with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Belfast City Council</a> to host hackathon events for the technology community and STEM students.</p>



<p>Also among the winners was Anaeko Limited, who received £3,000 to host events and marketing activities for entrepreneurs to develop sustainable business models leveraging Open Data.</p>



<p>Derry City and Strabane District Council in partnership with Carnegie UK Trust was awarded £3,000 to host cross sectoral workshops to tell the story of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon; Derry and Strabane; and Lisburn and Castlereagh Council council areas.</p>



<p>Newry 2020 received £4,995 to deliver an integrated environmental sensor network to assess the impact of human activities on the environment in Newry and £2,995 to host outreach events.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.xpandaccess.com/" target="_blank">Xpand Group</a> in partnership with Belfast City Council was awarded £4,960 to create a shared access platform to enable business case development and decision making for large scale regional projects, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://flaxandteal.co.uk/" target="_blank">Flax &amp; Teal Limited</a> received £5,000 to develop an environmental disaster simulation tool for use in education and emergency planning.</p>



<p>Northern Ireland&#8217;s Finance Minister&nbsp;<a href="http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/details.aspx?&amp;aff=13276&amp;per=80&amp;c=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conor Murphy</a>, who announced the winners, said: “This fund provides entrepreneurs and organisations with a real opportunity to use public sector data for commercial opportunities and drive future economic growth.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to meet the winners and hear more about the range of ingenious projects and events which will further develop digital skills while creating a culture of data transparency.</p>



<p>“It is encouraging to see the collaborative approach the winners have taken, working with community groups, businesses and local councils to optimise public sector data for research, outreach and innovation.”</p>



<p>Farset Labs is receiving £6,000 (as part of a budget of £11,000) to run the Data Art programme, including 6 Meetups, 6 Workshops and 4 Hackathons, and this budget allocation is directly to fund venue, refreshments, travel and equipment costs.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to participate in the programme or help run the project, join the Meetup Group below or contact dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk for more information.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our expansion and revovation - the biggest project in the history of the charity - is nearing the end of build schedule. Find out about the fantastic progress that has been made and the exciting new space for the community!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">expansion, renovation, and improvement</a> of Farset Labs is nearly finished, with the project on schedule and anticipated to only slip by a few days, which will not materially affect our timetable. A range of purpose-built features for the Event Space, workshop, and general accessibility have been included. Fundraising to further our charitable aims has started and you can find out how to contact us about this at the end of the post. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How time flies &#8211; we’re nearing the end of our eight week build schedule on the Farset Labs renovation and the results are looking fantastic so far. Our <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">Victorian schoolhouse</a>, which has been educating Belfast since 1883, is nearly ready to open its doors again. While the timetable has slipped by a few days, we&#8217;re still on target to be <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">back in by early October</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://eddiesextracts.com/books/staidanspics/StA_Linfield_Mill_School.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Image From <a href="https://eddiesextracts.com/books/staidans1930.html">&#8220;St. Aidan&#8217;s Church of Ireland, (Sandy Row) Belfast (1930)&#8221;</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We’re going to take this opportunity to share a few select photos from the project so far, starting right back at the beginning… (Or you can skip right to the <a href="#current-progress">current progress</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The story so far&#8230;</h2>



<p>After our big push to vacate the building, the construction firm wasted no time in starting demolition, which reduced Unit 1 to a rather sorry state.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181301.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181301-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="3129" data-full-url="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181301.jpg" data-link="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/?attachment_id=3129" class="wp-image-3129" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181301-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181301-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Demolition of the Event Space/Workshop wall</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181312.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181312-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="3130" data-full-url="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181312.jpg" data-link="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/?attachment_id=3130" class="wp-image-3130" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181312-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190729_181312-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Demolition in the old co-working space</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>However, it wasn’t long before the mess was cleared up and Unit 1 was a blank canvas again (more or less).</p>

<p>The bulk of the structural work was confined to the eastern end of the building, where a lift shaft was formed and two pre-existing openings were sealed up, with a new, wider opening made.</p>

<p>Demolition wasn’t confined to downstairs, although a previous contractor had torn down most of the internal studs upstairs several months previously in preparation for the project &#8211; the below images were actually taken as part of a Farset survey in early March 2019. </p>

<p>Some say this was briefly the premier toilet in Weavers Court &#8211; excellent south facing aspect, glorious afternoon light, fine views over a converted Victorian mill, wonderful sense of spaciousness&#8230;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the summertime work: due to the floor settling unevenly at the western end over the last century and a half, the joiners moved in to rectify the problem.</p>

<p>The major stud walls upstairs were erected pretty early in the project.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg" alt="In the upstairs desk space, looking east." class="wp-image-3144" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The studs between the desk space upstairs and the kitchenette/meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see the marks for widening the doorway seen in the previous photo. We’re looking east, with the kitchenette through to the left and the meeting room through to the right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg" alt="The hallway on the first floor." class="wp-image-3145" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The position of the lift shaft (seen here on the left with copious quantities of two-by-four and marine ply) and the existing stairwell (coming up through the purple door on the right) meant the lobby area was a peculiar shape, which we decided to keep open and make into the new lounge area. This will be a chill-out space, a social space, or simply a place to take a phone call or lunch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg" alt="Lift shaft under construction, seen from the new lounge area." class="wp-image-3148" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Standing in the new lounge area</figcaption></figure>



<p>The new first floor meeting room under construction, before the studs on the left of the image were reinforced for a wall-mounted display. Note also the cabling for power and HDMI to the floor box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room, looking south." class="wp-image-3149" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The upstairs meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back downstairs, we can see the little stud wall that was put in to provide power and support to the central workbench in the workshop. Originally, we had envisaged the power simply coming down the column, but solid iron is, of course, not the best material to work on for that purpose, so a heavily reinforced (almost all two-by-fours and ply) stud was built instead.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg" alt="Workshop stud wall in Farset Labs" class="wp-image-3150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Using a reinforced little stud wall to avoid having to work on the iron column</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the other end of the building, I returned from a trip away to a conference to find that the upstairs kitchenette and lift had seemingly appeared out of nowhere &#8211; appearances were deceiving, though, since most of the internals of the lift were still being worked on. Accessibility has been a very important consideration during this renovation, and a number of features have gone or are going into the building in order to help our users.</p>

<p><strong>These accessibility features include</strong>, but are not limited to: twin fire refuge points with two-way firefighter’s comms, installing distress call points in both disabled toilets, a new disabled toilet on the first floor, built to be compliant with the latest regulations, a high-contrast colour scheme throughout the Labs (high LRV differentials) to aid the navigation of visually impaired users, braille signage and wayfinding*, induction loops in the Event Space and meeting room*, drop-level workbenches in the workshop for wheelchair access to an electronics workstation, spaces such as the lounge area for users to decompress and avoid sensory overload, dual electric blinds for dimming rooms to different levels*, high CRI and lower colour temperature LED lighting to avoid fatigue and migraines from fluorescents/CFLs, hold-open fire doors to allow the option of door-free entry from street to the Event Space when an event is starting, and levelling and refitting nearly 4,000 sq ft of flooring, including the use of low-rolling resistance, healthcare-grade vinyl in the ground floor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="current-progress">Current Progress</h2>



<p>Finally, these most up-to-date images were all taken on one recent evening and should give an idea of the progress:</p>



<p>We start in the team room on the first floor, at the very western end of the building (we’re standing in the north-western corner) &#8211; the western fire escape is to the left. Unfortunately, though we fought for it, the beautiful ceiling is being covered up again by a new suspended ceiling. Perhaps something to return to in a future project.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking south-east." class="wp-image-3111" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>View of the same room from the opposite corner. This room will be our area for small teams, whether hobbyist or professional. Members can rent several desks and work together on projects, enjoying a higher degree of privacy and an included small meeting pod* (sited in the alcove visible here).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving into the next room, we can see the desk space, with eight large windows providing some really beautiful natural light throughout the day. The next image is the same view, but moved right slightly, standing in the door of the team room, and the final image is from the opposite end, looking west towards the doorway the previous image was taken in. There will be circa twenty desks in here, arranged with comfortable room all around, and also a couple of telephone booths*, print services, and storage.</p>

<p>Facing south, we find ourselves in the meeting room, now with the plasterboard on, which will have a large monitor for presentations, teleconferencing kit for collaboration*, and space for up to seven people to meet privately…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room" class="wp-image-3117" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>…and facing north, across the corridor, we can see the kitchenette, just before the piping for the boiler was boxed in.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs first floor kitchenette" class="wp-image-3118" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Going through the door at the end of the short corridor, in the lounge area, we can also glimpse the lift cabin being worked on at that moment in time. Through the doorway on the left is the toilets, cleaning cupboard, and electrical services for the floor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs lounge/first floor lobby, with a view of the lift being worked on." class="wp-image-3119" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The furthest wall that you can see, to the left of the window, will have shelving for our library of texts, classic gaming collection, magazines, and a large screen. The shelving will continue around into the alcove to the left (out of view) and there is hope a fish tank will also be included here, as a donation of materials and time from a member with previous experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving the camera round the corner to the right, with the lift to our back left, we get a better look at that alcove and the door to the main stairwell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Standing on the landing, we can see the entrances to both floors.</p>

<p>Coming down the stairs, we’re now in the new front doorway, which has become the entrance for both units. We hope to have mail-handling facilities on the left wall and ahead, in what will soon be behind a door, you can see part of the Tibus gear which provides our awesome internet connectivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs new main entrance hallway for both floors." class="wp-image-3122" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The new entrance for both floors</figcaption></figure>



<p>Walking past the ground floor lift lobby and into what was the old co-working space, the camera finds itself in the south western corner, where the networking cabinet used to sit. The alcove to right and the wall on the other side of the entrance hallway will both have lockers* for member storage installed in them. It is our current intention to fabricate some desk-level benches in the middle of the room and at the windows, offering comfortable and generous hotdesking space with power sockets and proper seating. Note the much higher plastered ceiling throughout the ground floor, exposing the beautiful ironwork and central wooden beam, which gives the whole space a very light and airy feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg" alt="View of the old co-working (new hot-desking) space in Farset Labs, which will also feature member storage." class="wp-image-3124" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The hot-desking space, which will also feature member storage</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve considerably widened our Event Space door, both for general people flow and for improved accessibility. Turning left through it, we can see the new Event Space, which has been enlarged by ~40%, giving considerably more usable space and flexibility than that figure would suggest. This will be kitted out with brand new tables with a non-folding tabletop, and brand new durable moulded chairs with cushions. Both the tables and chairs have been specified to include high-capacity trolley storage and the new store (alcove on the right of the image, waiting for double doors to be fitted) will hold the entire table and chair stock, allowing the Event Space to be completely empty, enhancing its capability as a multi-use space, particularly in light of plans to also integrate room-scale VR facilities into it*. Retractable drop-down power sockets for desk groups will be installed* to eliminate trailing cables and speed up setup time. We also have exciting plans* for best-in class AV to allow our members and external users, such as meet-up groups, access to a unique, highly specified facility.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3125" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving to the other side of the Event Space, we can see that it now has own-door access from the car park, allowing event organisers to welcome guests directly into the space in good weather. (Industrial clean-off carpet will be fitted at this and other entrances to prevent ingress of water/dirt.) The window to the workshop sits just beside it, allowing a connection between the two core rooms of the hackerspace. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking south-west." class="wp-image-3126" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The workshop is completely new, with sealed lighting fixtures, a large cored external hole for air extraction, emergency cut-off panic switches on sockets, a dedicated 20A supply for a down-draught vented 1,200°C+ <strong>kiln</strong>*, the same for a 4’ x 2’ <strong>CNC router</strong> with fourth axis*, space for a large (~1000mm x 600mm) <strong>laser cutter</strong> with dual (CO2 and MOPA fibre) diodes*, a Formlabs Form 3 <strong>3D Printer</strong> with wash and cure*, a large industrial sink with waste filtration (allowing, for example, ceramics work), FDM <strong>3D printers</strong>, a <strong>pedestal drill</strong>, a smaller <strong>CNC mill</strong> (Nomad 883 Pro)*, smaller <strong>laser cutter</strong> (Glowforge Pro)*, desktop <strong>vacuum former</strong>*, <strong>screen printer</strong>*, <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong>*, high quality hand tools, an industrial <strong>sewing machine</strong> &amp; overlocker*, computerised <strong>embroidery machine</strong>*, <strong>tailor’s form</strong>*, <strong>steam iron</strong>*, and two electronics workstations, with a <strong>reflow oven</strong>*, high-end <strong>Oscilloscopes</strong>*, bench top <strong>PSUs</strong>*, bench top <strong>multimeters</strong>*, <strong>microscopy</strong>*, <strong>PCB shear</strong>*, Weller <strong>solder/desolder stations</strong>*, Weller hot-air <strong>rework station</strong>*, and more. Whew!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs workshop, looking north-east, towards the Event Space." class="wp-image-3127" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Workshop &#8211; note the window to the Event Space</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, moving to the right, we get a view of the dedicated fire escape/separate entrance for the workshop, the new boiler room access door, and the aforementioned cored hole for extraction services. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that the philosophy for the workshop is to allow the creation of objects anywhere up to about a metre cubed, whether as prototypes, art, or whatever our members can imagine. We have placed a heavy emphasis on precision engineering and end-to-end electronics fabrication.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175204-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs workshop, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3128" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175204-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175204-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>That completes the tour of the work-in-progress &#8211; which I hope you&#8217;ve found helpful &#8211; and brings us to those little asterisks&#8230;</p>



<p>* <strong>Funding permitting</strong> &#8211; we’re currently fundraising for capital expenditure that will support us in achieving our charitable aims and increase the impact of the outcomes we already provide as a volunteer-led and -run organisation. If you’d like to hear more or discuss how you could help us provide <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html">STEAM outreach and education</a> for children, young people, and adults, as well as a <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/">community environment</a> for hobbyists, professionals, and everyone in between, from <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">arts to engineering</a>, we’d love to hear from you. Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> or, if you’d prefer to speak directly with me, feel free to give me a shout at <a href="mailto:david@farsetlabs.org.uk">david@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> and we can have a chat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the largest project the charity has ever undertaken, but we’re building on <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/03/launch-day-hackathon/">eight years</a> of experience, developing robust governance, and a wealth of knowledge from our volunteer teams; we’d love to have great partners on the next eight years of our journey!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At the ripe old age of seven, we're moving. But only for a while...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been over seven years since Northern Ireland&#8217;s hackerspace <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/03/launch-day-hackathon/">opened its doors</a> to the artists, engineers, and makers of Belfast. Farset Labs has spent that time delivering <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html">STEAM education</a>, providing a <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">space and tools</a> for the tech and creative scene, and being a focal point for <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/">events and meetups</a>. We&#8217;ve had a blast, and grown immensely, both as an organisation and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; as a community.</p>



<p>Many will have noticed that, over the past couple of years, it&#8217;s been getting rather cosy in Unit 1, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">our home</a> in Weavers Court Business Park. There&#8217;s just not <em>quite</em> enough room for everyone, the event space is regularly used for overflow from the co-working space, and the workshop is, well, regularly used for overflow from the event space!</p>



<p>We do, however, have some news to share (and some awkward weeks ahead of us).</p>



<p>In the middle of November last year, we got word from our landlord that the other tenants in building, who occupied the first floor, were departing and we were asked if we wanted to take it on. This scenario had been long discussed within the Farset Labs team, but now we had first refusal on occupying the entire building. </p>



<p>While the thought of more than doubling our floorspace was a daunting one, we sharpened our pencils and kicked off the due diligence, and have been working with the team at Weavers Court for the last eight months to bring this dream to reality.</p>



<p>After many, <em>many</em> delays, complications, surveyors, consultations, and long weekends of planning, shuffling, and boxing, we&#8217;ve set in motion both the biggest and riskiest manoeuvre that the charity has attempted yet. </p>



<p>The next few months are going to see major changes happening at your community hackerspace, as we begin a programme of renovations and expansion that will stand us in good stead for the next eight years and beyond. Our current location, <strong>Unit 1, will be shut to members</strong> in the coming weeks and <strong>completely emptied by Friday 19th July</strong>, while our new temporary premises, <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A9TP1Waz369omwRm8">Unit 5E</a>, will be available for use from the week beginning Monday 1st July. </strong></p>



<p>We hope to take possession of Unit 1 again in late September and, following a period of internal fit out, have it <strong>fully open</strong> <strong>again in Early October</strong>. We know that this will cause disruption to many of the usual activities that take place in Farset Labs, but we are seeking to minimise the impact where possible, and Farset Labs will remain open throughout, though in a substantially smaller space</p>



<p>We’re very excited to share the new space with the community and if you’d like to know more about what is planned, please read on.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Further information:</strong></p>



<p>The renovation and expansion of the hackerspace is a large project that involves Farset Labs more than doubling its floor space by taking possession of the unit above us, making us the sole tenants of our beloved old Victorian schoolhouse, just five minutes from Great Victoria Street and on the doorstep of Weavers Cross, the new transport hub.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3093" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Our building, which was once used as the schoolhouse for the old linen mill</figcaption></figure>



<p>This gives us the opportunity to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Provide up to <strong>40 additional dedicated desk spaces</strong> upstairs in a bright and airy environment</li><li><strong>Expand our workshop</strong>, adding a new fire exit and access control</li><li><strong>Increase the size of our flexible event space</strong> and improve AV facilities</li><li>Create a <strong>new multipurpose space </strong>suited for art projects, teams, startups etc</li><li>Move the lounge upstairs and create a <strong>new dedicated meeting room</strong></li><li>Add <strong>call booths</strong>*, a second kitchenette, and additional toilets upstairs</li><li>Provide <strong>lift access</strong> to the new floor so everyone can use it</li><li>Finally, we will now have a <strong>single, unified entrance</strong> hallway for both floors</li></ul>



<p>There are many other small tweaks and additions, too numerous to list here, from new bench tops in the ground floor kitchenette, to improved sound proofing between floors, and furniture storage for the event space.</p>



<p>This improved canvas has also prompted us to reevaluate the equipment and facilities in the space. Since we’ll be redistributing member storage spaces from the workshop to across the building, we can now access-control the workshop and certain tools within it. This means training will be required to enter it, and further training will be required to energise and use certain tools, which will enable us to accommodate more advanced equipment and processes than we’ve been able to support so far.</p>



<p>We have identified the following as priorities and will be seeking further input from the wider community soon on shaping this list:</p>



<ul><li>New workshop equipment:<ul><li>Small laser cutter*</li><li>Small vacuum former</li><li>Small CNC router*</li><li>Benchtop small lathe*</li><li>FDM and SLA/DLP/LCD 3D Printers*</li><li>Benchtop power supplies*</li><li>Oscilloscopes</li><li>Logic analyser*</li><li>PCB stereo microscope</li><li>Dust and fume extraction</li><li>Heavy duty sewing machine</li><li>Hot wire cutter*<br /></li></ul></li><li>Event space:<ul><li>Updated ultra-bright projection*</li><li>1.2kW RMS surround sound system</li><li>Event recording/streaming equipment*</li><li>New lighting and backdrop options<br /></li></ul></li><li>Elsewhere:<ul><li>New information displays</li><li>Access control throughout</li><li>Systems for smart management of heating, lighting etc in the space</li><li>Teleconferencing facilities</li><li>New plants and eco friendly features</li><li>Fixtures for displaying art and member projects</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This list is not exhaustive and is dependent on reaching our target level of funding (items highlighted by an asterisk* indicate inclusion in our fundraising drive).</p>



<p>Accessibility was a key consideration in this expansion, and despite many difficulties with providing it in the structure of the old building, <strong>a lift will be installed</strong> to allow wheelchair/reduced mobility access to all spaces. In addition, key doors are being replaced and widened, improving flow throughout the space for all users. Certain doors, where possible, will also be electromagnetically held to eliminate the need to open them.</p>



<p>The new spaces have been designed to make it as easy as possible for members with accessibility needs to access them, with Farset Labs providing high contrast surfaces, induction loops, and Braille signage where possible. We remain firm in our commitment that people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds should be able to enjoy our space, and we are doing our best to provide this within our means.</p>



<p><strong>(Presumptive) FAQs</strong>:</p>



<p><em>I have stuff in Farset, what’s gonna happen to it?</em><br />All member storage boxes will still be available in our new, temporary location, Unit 5E and will be moved over with the rest of the equipment and furniture. If your stuff isn’t in a box, you can either collect it or let us know what you would like done with it via email or Slack.</p>



<p><em>What’s going to happen to [insert event or programme here]?</em><br />We’re going to try our best to keep “Minimum Viable Farset” going in the time being, but that’s going to be mostly co-working/hot-desking, as we’re moving from 2000 sq. ft over multiple rooms, to circa 600 sq. ft over a single room. We’ve shut down the CoderDojo for summer, as well as a few other regular events, and we won’t be taking most new event bookings for the period that we’re in our temporary location. However, these will all be coming back after the move!<br /></p>



<p><em>Who’s paying for all this?</em><br />The reason for the major renovation is related to the building (which hasn’t been fully renovated in about thirty years), rather than our tenancy, so the work being done to the fabric of the building is within the purview of the landlord (although they’ve kindly integrated some of our ideas and requests into the building plans). As for all the office furnishings, decoration, equipment, etc, we’ll be using core funds for that from members dues, so it’s still “our” space. However, we want to do this right, so we’ll be raising funds to make the transition as smooth as possible, and leave us with the best space we can manage.</p>



<p><em>What’s the network like in 5E?</em><br />We’ve worked with our good friends at <a href="https://www.tibus.com/connectivity-solutions/tibus-ultrafast-internet/">Tibus</a> to make sure it’s <em>almost</em> as awesome as the connection in Unit 1. A couple of years ago, we invested in some additional FTTC equipment as part of the <a href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/belfast-invites-new-businesses-get-super-connected">Super Connected Communities</a> programme and we won’t be able to migrate that over with us to our temporary location, so it’s not exactly the same, but it&#8217;s still a very solid and performant connection.</p>



<p><em>How is access going to work in Unit 5E?</em><br />We will be fitting a mechanical code lock this week and distributing the sequence to members, so access will be largely the same as in Unit 1 once it is set up. </p>



<p><em>How is this expansion going to effect membership dues?</em><br />We hope it won’t directly, however, we haven’t changed membership dues in over five years, so as part of the “settling in” period, we’ll be consulting with the membership on the charity&#8217;s cashflows and revenue calculations, so that we can make decisions about the long term sustainability of the community together.</p>



<p>One of the major motivations for the expansion is to increase the number of hackers, makers, and breakers that we can accommodate, and this increase in membership will offset the increased rent/electricity/heating costs so that Farset Labs can continue to be core-funded by the community</p>



<p><strong>Further questions?</strong></p>



<p>Please direct any enquiries to <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> or to @managers on the <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Labs Slack</a> and we will be happy to answer them. We have been trying to keep members updated through our Town Hall meetings and external event organisers updated via email, but if you have any specific concerns, please get in touch.</p>
