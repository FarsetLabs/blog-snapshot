										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">expansion, renovation, and improvement</a> of Farset Labs is nearly finished, with the project on schedule and anticipated to only slip by a few days, which will not materially affect our timetable. A range of purpose-built features for the Event Space, workshop, and general accessibility have been included. Fundraising to further our charitable aims has started and you can find out how to contact us about this at the end of the post. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How time flies &#8211; we’re nearing the end of our eight week build schedule on the Farset Labs renovation and the results are looking fantastic so far. Our <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">Victorian schoolhouse</a>, which has been educating Belfast since 1883, is nearly ready to open its doors again. While the timetable has slipped by a few days, we&#8217;re still on target to be <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">back in by early October</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to take this opportunity to share a few select photos from the project so far, starting right back at the beginning… (Or you can skip right to the <a href="#current-progress">current progress</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The story so far&#8230;</h2>



<p>After our big push to vacate the building, the construction firm wasted no time in starting demolition, which reduced Unit 1 to a rather sorry state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t long before the mess was cleared up and Unit 1 was a blank canvas again (more or less).</p>

<p>The bulk of the structural work was confined to the eastern end of the building, where a lift shaft was formed and two pre-existing openings were sealed up, with a new, wider opening made.</p>

<p>Demolition wasn’t confined to downstairs, although a previous contractor had torn down most of the internal studs upstairs several months previously in preparation for the project &#8211; the below images were actually taken as part of a Farset survey in early March 2019. </p>

<p>Some say this was briefly the premier toilet in Weavers Court &#8211; excellent south facing aspect, glorious afternoon light, fine views over a converted Victorian mill, wonderful sense of spaciousness&#8230;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the summertime work: due to the floor settling unevenly at the western end over the last century and a half, the joiners moved in to rectify the problem.</p>

<p>The major stud walls upstairs were erected pretty early in the project.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg" alt="In the upstairs desk space, looking east." class="wp-image-3144" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The studs between the desk space upstairs and the kitchenette/meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see the marks for widening the doorway seen in the previous photo. We’re looking east, with the kitchenette through to the left and the meeting room through to the right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg" alt="The hallway on the first floor." class="wp-image-3145" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The position of the lift shaft (seen here on the left with copious quantities of two-by-four and marine ply) and the existing stairwell (coming up through the purple door on the right) meant the lobby area was a peculiar shape, which we decided to keep open and make into the new lounge area. This will be a chill-out space, a social space, or simply a place to take a phone call or lunch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg" alt="Lift shaft under construction, seen from the new lounge area." class="wp-image-3148" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Standing in the new lounge area</figcaption></figure>



<p>The new first floor meeting room under construction, before the studs on the left of the image were reinforced for a wall-mounted display. Note also the cabling for power and HDMI to the floor box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room, looking south." class="wp-image-3149" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The upstairs meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back downstairs, we can see the little stud wall that was put in to provide power and support to the central workbench in the workshop. Originally, we had envisaged the power simply coming down the column, but solid iron is, of course, not the best material to work on for that purpose, so a heavily reinforced (almost all two-by-fours and ply) stud was built instead.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg" alt="Workshop stud wall in Farset Labs" class="wp-image-3150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Using a reinforced little stud wall to avoid having to work on the iron column</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the other end of the building, I returned from a trip away to a conference to find that the upstairs kitchenette and lift had seemingly appeared out of nowhere &#8211; appearances were deceiving, though, since most of the internals of the lift were still being worked on. Accessibility has been a very important consideration during this renovation, and a number of features have gone or are going into the building in order to help our users.</p>

<p><strong>These accessibility features include</strong>, but are not limited to: twin fire refuge points with two-way firefighter’s comms, installing distress call points in both disabled toilets, a new disabled toilet on the first floor, built to be compliant with the latest regulations, a high-contrast colour scheme throughout the Labs (high LRV differentials) to aid the navigation of visually impaired users, braille signage and wayfinding*, induction loops in the Event Space and meeting room*, drop-level workbenches in the workshop for wheelchair access to an electronics workstation, spaces such as the lounge area for users to decompress and avoid sensory overload, dual electric blinds for dimming rooms to different levels*, high CRI and lower colour temperature LED lighting to avoid fatigue and migraines from fluorescents/CFLs, hold-open fire doors to allow the option of door-free entry from street to the Event Space when an event is starting, and levelling and refitting nearly 4,000 sq ft of flooring, including the use of low-rolling resistance, healthcare-grade vinyl in the ground floor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="current-progress">Current Progress</h2>



<p>Finally, these most up-to-date images were all taken on one recent evening and should give an idea of the progress:</p>



<p>We start in the team room on the first floor, at the very western end of the building (we’re standing in the north-western corner) &#8211; the western fire escape is to the left. Unfortunately, though we fought for it, the beautiful ceiling is being covered up again by a new suspended ceiling. Perhaps something to return to in a future project.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking south-east." class="wp-image-3111" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>View of the same room from the opposite corner. This room will be our area for small teams, whether hobbyist or professional. Members can rent several desks and work together on projects, enjoying a higher degree of privacy and an included small meeting pod* (sited in the alcove visible here).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving into the next room, we can see the desk space, with eight large windows providing some really beautiful natural light throughout the day. The next image is the same view, but moved right slightly, standing in the door of the team room, and the final image is from the opposite end, looking west towards the doorway the previous image was taken in. There will be circa twenty desks in here, arranged with comfortable room all around, and also a couple of telephone booths*, print services, and storage.</p>

<p>Facing south, we find ourselves in the meeting room, now with the plasterboard on, which will have a large monitor for presentations, teleconferencing kit for collaboration*, and space for up to seven people to meet privately…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room" class="wp-image-3117" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>…and facing north, across the corridor, we can see the kitchenette, just before the piping for the boiler was boxed in.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs first floor kitchenette" class="wp-image-3118" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Going through the door at the end of the short corridor, in the lounge area, we can also glimpse the lift cabin being worked on at that moment in time. Through the doorway on the left is the toilets, cleaning cupboard, and electrical services for the floor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs lounge/first floor lobby, with a view of the lift being worked on." class="wp-image-3119" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The furthest wall that you can see, to the left of the window, will have shelving for our library of texts, classic gaming collection, magazines, and a large screen. The shelving will continue around into the alcove to the left (out of view) and there is hope a fish tank will also be included here, as a donation of materials and time from a member with previous experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving the camera round the corner to the right, with the lift to our back left, we get a better look at that alcove and the door to the main stairwell.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs lounge area." class="wp-image-3120" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Standing on the landing, we can see the entrances to both floors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172311-768x1024.jpg" alt="View from the landing between the ground and first floors of Farset Labs.

<p>Coming down the stairs, we’re now in the new front doorway, which has become the entrance for both units. We hope to have mail-handling facilities on the left wall and ahead, in what will soon be behind a door, you can see part of the Tibus gear which provides our awesome internet connectivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs new main entrance hallway for both floors." class="wp-image-3122" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The new entrance for both floors</figcaption></figure>



<p>Walking past the ground floor lift lobby and into what was the old co-working space, the camera finds itself in the south western corner, where the networking cabinet used to sit. The alcove to right and the wall on the other side of the entrance hallway will both have lockers* for member storage installed in them. It is our current intention to fabricate some desk-level benches in the middle of the room and at the windows, offering comfortable and generous hotdesking space with power sockets and proper seating. Note the much higher plastered ceiling throughout the ground floor, exposing the beautiful ironwork and central wooden beam, which gives the whole space a very light and airy feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg" alt="View of the old co-working (new hot-desking) space in Farset Labs, which will also feature member storage." class="wp-image-3124" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The hot-desking space, which will also feature member storage</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve considerably widened our Event Space door, both for general people flow and for improved accessibility. Turning left through it, we can see the new Event Space, which has been enlarged by ~40%, giving considerably more usable space and flexibility than that figure would suggest. This will be kitted out with brand new tables with a non-folding tabletop, and brand new durable moulded chairs with cushions. Both the tables and chairs have been specified to include high-capacity trolley storage and the new store (alcove on the right of the image, waiting for double doors to be fitted) will hold the entire table and chair stock, allowing the Event Space to be completely empty, enhancing its capability as a multi-use space, particularly in light of plans to also integrate room-scale VR facilities into it*. Retractable drop-down power sockets for desk groups will be installed* to eliminate trailing cables and speed up setup time. We also have exciting plans* for best-in class AV to allow our members and external users, such as meet-up groups, access to a unique, highly specified facility.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3125" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving to the other side of the Event Space, we can see that it now has own-door access from the car park, allowing event organisers to welcome guests directly into the space in good weather. (Industrial clean-off carpet will be fitted at this and other entrances to prevent ingress of water/dirt.) The window to the workshop sits just beside it, allowing a connection between the two core rooms of the hackerspace. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking south-west." class="wp-image-3126" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The workshop is completely new, with sealed lighting fixtures, a large cored external hole for air extraction, emergency cut-off panic switches on sockets, a dedicated 20A supply for a down-draught vented 1,200°C+ <strong>kiln</strong>*, the same for a 4’ x 2’ <strong>CNC router</strong> with fourth axis*, space for a large (~1000mm x 600mm) <strong>laser cutter</strong> with dual (CO2 and MOPA fibre) diodes*, a Formlabs Form 3 <strong>3D Printer</strong> with wash and cure*, a large industrial sink with waste filtration (allowing, for example, ceramics work), FDM <strong>3D printers</strong>, a <strong>pedestal drill</strong>, a smaller <strong>CNC mill</strong> (Nomad 883 Pro)*, smaller <strong>laser cutter</strong> (Glowforge Pro)*, desktop <strong>vacuum former</strong>*, <strong>screen printer</strong>*, <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong>*, high quality hand tools, an industrial <strong>sewing machine</strong> &amp; overlocker*, computerised <strong>embroidery machine</strong>*, <strong>tailor’s form</strong>*, <strong>steam iron</strong>*, and two electronics workstations, with a <strong>reflow oven</strong>*, high-end <strong>Oscilloscopes</strong>*, bench top <strong>PSUs</strong>*, bench top <strong>multimeters</strong>*, <strong>microscopy</strong>*, <strong>PCB shear</strong>*, Weller <strong>solder/desolder stations</strong>*, Weller hot-air <strong>rework station</strong>*, and more. Whew!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs workshop, looking north-east, towards the Event Space." class="wp-image-3127" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Workshop &#8211; note the window to the Event Space</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, moving to the right, we get a view of the dedicated fire escape/separate entrance for the workshop, the new boiler room access door, and the aforementioned cored hole for extraction services. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that the philosophy for the workshop is to allow the creation of objects anywhere up to about a metre cubed, whether as prototypes, art, or whatever our members can imagine. We have placed a heavy emphasis on precision engineering and end-to-end electronics fabrication.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At the ripe old age of seven, we're moving. But only for a while...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been over seven years since Northern Ireland&#8217;s hackerspace <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/03/launch-day-hackathon/">opened its doors</a> to the artists, engineers, and makers of Belfast. Farset Labs has spent that time delivering <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html">STEAM education</a>, providing a <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">space and tools</a> for the tech and creative scene, and being a focal point for <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/">events and meetups</a>. We&#8217;ve had a blast, and grown immensely, both as an organisation and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; as a community.</p>



<p>Many will have noticed that, over the past couple of years, it&#8217;s been getting rather cosy in Unit 1, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">our home</a> in Weavers Court Business Park. There&#8217;s just not <em>quite</em> enough room for everyone, the event space is regularly used for overflow from the co-working space, and the workshop is, well, regularly used for overflow from the event space!</p>



<p>We do, however, have some news to share (and some awkward weeks ahead of us).</p>



<p>In the middle of November last year, we got word from our landlord that the other tenants in building, who occupied the first floor, were departing and we were asked if we wanted to take it on. This scenario had been long discussed within the Farset Labs team, but now we had first refusal on occupying the entire building. </p>



<p>While the thought of more than doubling our floorspace was a daunting one, we sharpened our pencils and kicked off the due diligence, and have been working with the team at Weavers Court for the last eight months to bring this dream to reality.</p>



<p>After many, <em>many</em> delays, complications, surveyors, consultations, and long weekends of planning, shuffling, and boxing, we&#8217;ve set in motion both the biggest and riskiest manoeuvre that the charity has attempted yet. </p>



<p>The next few months are going to see major changes happening at your community hackerspace, as we begin a programme of renovations and expansion that will stand us in good stead for the next eight years and beyond. Our current location, <strong>Unit 1, will be shut to members</strong> in the coming weeks and <strong>completely emptied by Friday 19th July</strong>, while our new temporary premises, <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A9TP1Waz369omwRm8">Unit 5E</a>, will be available for use from the week beginning Monday 1st July. </strong></p>



<p>We hope to take possession of Unit 1 again in late September and, following a period of internal fit out, have it <strong>fully open</strong> <strong>again in Early October</strong>. We know that this will cause disruption to many of the usual activities that take place in Farset Labs, but we are seeking to minimise the impact where possible, and Farset Labs will remain open throughout, though in a substantially smaller space</p>



<p>We’re very excited to share the new space with the community and if you’d like to know more about what is planned, please read on.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Further information:</strong></p>



<p>The renovation and expansion of the hackerspace is a large project that involves Farset Labs more than doubling its floor space by taking possession of the unit above us, making us the sole tenants of our beloved old Victorian schoolhouse, just five minutes from Great Victoria Street and on the doorstep of Weavers Cross, the new transport hub.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3093" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Our building, which was once used as the schoolhouse for the old linen mill</figcaption></figure>



<p>This gives us the opportunity to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Provide up to <strong>40 additional dedicated desk spaces</strong> upstairs in a bright and airy environment</li><li><strong>Expand our workshop</strong>, adding a new fire exit and access control</li><li><strong>Increase the size of our flexible event space</strong> and improve AV facilities</li><li>Create a <strong>new multipurpose space </strong>suited for art projects, teams, startups etc</li><li>Move the lounge upstairs and create a <strong>new dedicated meeting room</strong></li><li>Add <strong>call booths</strong>*, a second kitchenette, and additional toilets upstairs</li><li>Provide <strong>lift access</strong> to the new floor so everyone can use it</li><li>Finally, we will now have a <strong>single, unified entrance</strong> hallway for both floors</li></ul>



<p>There are many other small tweaks and additions, too numerous to list here, from new bench tops in the ground floor kitchenette, to improved sound proofing between floors, and furniture storage for the event space.</p>



<p>This improved canvas has also prompted us to reevaluate the equipment and facilities in the space. Since we’ll be redistributing member storage spaces from the workshop to across the building, we can now access-control the workshop and certain tools within it. This means training will be required to enter it, and further training will be required to energise and use certain tools, which will enable us to accommodate more advanced equipment and processes than we’ve been able to support so far.</p>



<p>We have identified the following as priorities and will be seeking further input from the wider community soon on shaping this list:</p>



<ul><li>New workshop equipment:<ul><li>Small laser cutter*</li><li>Small vacuum former</li><li>Small CNC router*</li><li>Benchtop small lathe*</li><li>FDM and SLA/DLP/LCD 3D Printers*</li><li>Benchtop power supplies*</li><li>Oscilloscopes</li><li>Logic analyser*</li><li>PCB stereo microscope</li><li>Dust and fume extraction</li><li>Heavy duty sewing machine</li><li>Hot wire cutter*<br /></li></ul></li><li>Event space:<ul><li>Updated ultra-bright projection*</li><li>1.2kW RMS surround sound system</li><li>Event recording/streaming equipment*</li><li>New lighting and backdrop options<br /></li></ul></li><li>Elsewhere:<ul><li>New information displays</li><li>Access control throughout</li><li>Systems for smart management of heating, lighting etc in the space</li><li>Teleconferencing facilities</li><li>New plants and eco friendly features</li><li>Fixtures for displaying art and member projects</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This list is not exhaustive and is dependent on reaching our target level of funding (items highlighted by an asterisk* indicate inclusion in our fundraising drive).</p>



<p>Accessibility was a key consideration in this expansion, and despite many difficulties with providing it in the structure of the old building, <strong>a lift will be installed</strong> to allow wheelchair/reduced mobility access to all spaces. In addition, key doors are being replaced and widened, improving flow throughout the space for all users. Certain doors, where possible, will also be electromagnetically held to eliminate the need to open them.</p>



<p>The new spaces have been designed to make it as easy as possible for members with accessibility needs to access them, with Farset Labs providing high contrast surfaces, induction loops, and Braille signage where possible. We remain firm in our commitment that people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds should be able to enjoy our space, and we are doing our best to provide this within our means.</p>



<p><strong>(Presumptive) FAQs</strong>:</p>



<p><em>I have stuff in Farset, what’s gonna happen to it?</em><br />All member storage boxes will still be available in our new, temporary location, Unit 5E and will be moved over with the rest of the equipment and furniture. If your stuff isn’t in a box, you can either collect it or let us know what you would like done with it via email or Slack.</p>



<p><em>What’s going to happen to [insert event or programme here]?</em><br />We’re going to try our best to keep “Minimum Viable Farset” going in the time being, but that’s going to be mostly co-working/hot-desking, as we’re moving from 2000 sq. ft over multiple rooms, to circa 600 sq. ft over a single room. We’ve shut down the CoderDojo for summer, as well as a few other regular events, and we won’t be taking most new event bookings for the period that we’re in our temporary location. However, these will all be coming back after the move!<br /></p>



<p><em>Who’s paying for all this?</em><br />The reason for the major renovation is related to the building (which hasn’t been fully renovated in about thirty years), rather than our tenancy, so the work being done to the fabric of the building is within the purview of the landlord (although they’ve kindly integrated some of our ideas and requests into the building plans). As for all the office furnishings, decoration, equipment, etc, we’ll be using core funds for that from members dues, so it’s still “our” space. However, we want to do this right, so we’ll be raising funds to make the transition as smooth as possible, and leave us with the best space we can manage.</p>



<p><em>What’s the network like in 5E?</em><br />We’ve worked with our good friends at <a href="https://www.tibus.com/connectivity-solutions/tibus-ultrafast-internet/">Tibus</a> to make sure it’s <em>almost</em> as awesome as the connection in Unit 1. A couple of years ago, we invested in some additional FTTC equipment as part of the <a href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/belfast-invites-new-businesses-get-super-connected">Super Connected Communities</a> programme and we won’t be able to migrate that over with us to our temporary location, so it’s not exactly the same, but it&#8217;s still a very solid and performant connection.</p>



<p><em>How is access going to work in Unit 5E?</em><br />We will be fitting a mechanical code lock this week and distributing the sequence to members, so access will be largely the same as in Unit 1 once it is set up. </p>



<p><em>How is this expansion going to effect membership dues?</em><br />We hope it won’t directly, however, we haven’t changed membership dues in over five years, so as part of the “settling in” period, we’ll be consulting with the membership on the charity&#8217;s cashflows and revenue calculations, so that we can make decisions about the long term sustainability of the community together.</p>



<p>One of the major motivations for the expansion is to increase the number of hackers, makers, and breakers that we can accommodate, and this increase in membership will offset the increased rent/electricity/heating costs so that Farset Labs can continue to be core-funded by the community</p>



<p><strong>Further questions?</strong></p>



<p>Please direct any enquiries to <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> or to @managers on the <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Labs Slack</a> and we will be happy to answer them. We have been trying to keep members updated through our Town Hall meetings and external event organisers updated via email, but if you have any specific concerns, please get in touch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has accomplished a lot in the past <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/01/what-is-farset-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 years</a>, stimulated by the goodwill of the STEAM community, and underpinned by the direct financial support of the membership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like many others in the community and voluntary sector, we face continually rising overheads despite efficiently delivering our charitable aims. As such, we’re exploring a new revenue stream: <strong>in-space advertising</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, we will be putting up four A3 poster panels in the co-working space and workshop on a three-month trial basis, available on rolling monthly hire by outside organisations and companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These poster locations will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis at the discretion of the Farset Labs management team, and posters must be provided by the advertiser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are currently priced as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community/charitable/non-profit groups advertising events, programmes &amp; opportunities: £150pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct advertisement of goods, services &amp; jobs: £300pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indirect promotion of recruitment services &amp; non-specific roles: £600pm</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d be interested in participating in this trial, contact us on <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of this three month period, the results and impact will be assessed openly in the community along with trial participants, and any modifications deemed necessary will be made before restarting the programme. Trial participants will have early-access into the continued programme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new revenue stream will give Farset Labs a more stable platform from which we can cover our increasing operational costs and focus on reinvesting in our services and facilities. We want to achieve this without having to put any more financial pressure on the members of our community who need access to these resources the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has been a fully membership-funded community space, delivering volunteer-driven <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2017/01/farset-dojo-2017-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outreach</a>, <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/free-workshop-for-secondary-teachers-introduction-to-bbc-microbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a>, and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/launching-makerassemblyni-16th-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facilitation</a> to the STEAM community; from programming &amp; engineering courses at local primary and secondary schools, to taking part in national and global collaborative events such as <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/12/global-game-jam-2017-20th-22nd-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Game Jam</a> and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/bbcmakeitdigital-connected-home-roadshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC’s Make It Digital </a>campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, we have been a melting pot for meetups and user-groups, with our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/how-to-start-a-class">free use of our event space on Wednesday evenings</a> for qualifying non-profit groups and individuals, where organisers can test the viability of their event ideas, developing communities that can (and usually do) rapidly grow to join the major meetup circuit beyond Farset Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the nature of the community fostered under our roof, Farset Labs has also hosted and spun-through a number of successful member-run startups, giving entrepreneurs the freedom to explore, collaborate, and experiment without losing equity or requiring significant upfront costs (<a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Desk rental</a> starts at £100 per month, but <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/hotdesk/">hot desking</a> is included at all membership levels).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this while operating on what can only be described as a &#8220;lean&#8221; budget. With no staff, no salaries, and no institutional funding, we have kept our significant outgoings limited to rent, power, heating (most of the time), cleaning and refuse collection, and insurance/accounting/<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/11/farset-labs-legal-encounter/">legal</a> fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, your company or your organisation wish to support the work of Farset Labs, or are interested in engaging with this unique community, get in touch via email to </span><a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tweet us at <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs">@FarsetLabs.</a></span></p>

</p>
<p>But the speakers don&#8217;t make the conference; the attendees do, and while we&#8217;re not publishing our invited attendee list, it&#8217;s pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>The conference will explore a series of topics around making, with a focus on critical discussion about the current state of the maker culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:00</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration and coffee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:30</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome address</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:45</span> <b>Session 1: Making &amp; Peace Building</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kicking off Maker Assembly NI is a session about the politics and nuances of community-facing digital fabrication projects. It will look at how maker cultures are emerging at the grassroots and how local organisations are contributing to the peace-building project currently underway in Northern Ireland. It hopes to reveal how the idea of ‘critical making’ can be adjusted to suit the specificities of different contexts.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Wallace &amp; Eamon Durey, Fab Labs NI, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Peto, Nerve Centre</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12:00</span> <b>Session 2: Speculative Making: New Contexts and Futures</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the idea of digital making beds down—and practices become more visible and accessible—what new trajectories are emerging and how are speculative futures being framed? This session hopes to reveal the supports we might need to maintain a critical forecast of making and maker culture.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nora O’Murchu, University of Limerick, </span><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Kat Braybrooke, University of Sussex</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13:00</span> <b>Lunch</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">14:00</span> <b>Session 3: Governance, Sustainability &amp; Maker Networks</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are maker networks nurtured and sustained? And how ‘critical&#8217; are the governance </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategies of the physical spaces and networked platforms that mediate maker networks? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This session hopes to somewhat unravel the entanglements of people, places, and things, to better understand how maker culture is being facilitated.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Javier Burón, Fab Lab Limerick &amp; University of Limerick, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannah Stewart, Royal College of Art, Future Makerspaces Project</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15:30</span> <b>Session 4: Critics of the world, create!</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final session to be a making exercise, inspired by the Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska’s (2012) Creative Media Manifesto and Garnet Hertz’s Critical Making zine series.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17:00</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing remarks and Networking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">18:00</span> Bus to the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pub &#8211; BREWBOT</span><a href="http://www.brewbotbelfast.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.brewbotbelfast.com/</span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you believe it has been <a title="Still Alive" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/still-alive/" target="_blank">3 years </a>since we opened our doors?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to have a bit of a party, and Farset Labs invite you to come and celebrate with us on Monday 13th April &#8211; as a thank you for helping us on our way, and to look forward to many more years of nurturing local creative and technology endeavours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve run this crazy ship on the tireless input of a bunch of visionary volunteers. I am in a constant state of wonder and gratitude for this continued effort. Nobody asks for thanks in return but it&#8217;s always nice when the good karma pays off a little.</p>
<p>The <a title="Hello World Foundation" href="http://helloworldfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Hello World Foundation</a> is kindly sending us some free <a title="Raspberry Pi" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pis</a>! With these, we can do more not only to introduce kids to the power of coding, but also to become more familiar with the inner workings of computers and electronics, rather than seeing computers as impregnable black boxes.</p>
<p>The Foundation exists to create the world’s leading network of affiliated coding clubs for young people. It&#8217;s a new organisation, formed on the heels of <a title="CoderDojo" href="http://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> by the same organisation&#8217;s founder, Ireland&#8217;s own <a title="James Whelton" href="http://coderdojo.com/founders" target="_blank">James Whelton</a>. On behalf of the Farset Labs CoderDojo, thanks to you all.</p>

<p>The Farset Labs Bring-And-Buy sale enables community members and others to sell or swap their creations, or their attic-junk.</p>
<p>The rules are simple, £5/table for members, £10/table for non-members, and don&#8217;t try to sell anything illegal.</p>
<p>If you want to attend and check out the wares on offer, don&#8217;t worry about tickets, just show up! (Although, non-members attending are ecouraged to donate on arrival&#8230;)</p>
<p>Get building and get selling!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our long and exciting <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume campaign</a> is finally over, and there is evidently plenty of support for a 3D printer within the space &#8211; we raised over £100 extra by the time the fundraiser was finished. In the time that it ran, we saw very evident spikes and patterns, which coincided nicely with various announcements and media publishers.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg1.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-853" title="oimg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg-300x1851.png" alt="Breakdown of rewards" width="300" height="185" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-853" class="wp-caption-text">Breakdown of donators by which reward they chose</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who helped get the word out about the campaign, and would especially like to thank every single person who backed the Sponsume appeal. Even now we are getting occasional offers from people who want to chip in a little more towards consumables. We hope that everyone that donated enjoys their rewards, which will be sent out in the following weeks after they are all organised and produced.</p>
<p>Once the custom print rewards are finished, the 3D printer will be open for every member of Farset Labs to access whenever they wish. Significant quantities of PLA and ABS plastic have been ordered, and this is open for all members to use in small-scale production. Anyone wishing to make lots of models or make very big items is requested to play fair and <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">buy their own plastic</a>, or donate towards getting more for the space. Apart from that, there are absolutely no restrictions on use, and we look forward to seeing what people make with the machine.</p>
<p>The Ultimaker is <strong>now in the post</strong>, and is expected within around a week. Announcements will be made when it arrives, and everyone involved in the fundraiser and purchase will be invited down to build and be the first to use it.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone that helped. Thanks to you, we now have a fantastic tool to make Farset Labs a much more useful and interesting place.</p>
