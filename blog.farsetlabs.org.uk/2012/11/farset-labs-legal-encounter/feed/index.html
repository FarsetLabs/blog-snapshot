					<description><![CDATA[ill tell you a story about an asshole kid that thought he was was leet, so he left a reverse shell open to an amazon cloud from his work desktop the day he left.  He was stealing code, then when he got caught he cried like a baby.  He handed over all his personal shit to the police who had a good laugh at his Tranny porn he had on his Mac that he tried to hide (badly).  Bottom line is the script kiddy was pissing on his door step and got caught, how can you defend that Farsett Labs?  Latens actually dropped the charges because they didn&#039;t want to destory the guys future and give him a second change.  CAS is Latens bread and butter, stealing the code for any purpose is stealing from the many people that work for the company and developed the product, what makes you feel you can just take a copy cause you worked there for under a year?  Many peoples incomes depend of Latens now go back to your rich mummy and daddy and ask them for another Macbook and NAS you twat.]]></description>

My sympathies are with the member involved and the whole Farset Labs team and I hope that this can be resolved quickly and painlessly (from now on)]]></description>

That any technology firm thinks it can make utterly unrealistic, unfeasible, unimplemental quite possibly illegal demands via solicitors... is it the 1990s? Did I travel back in time?]]></description>
