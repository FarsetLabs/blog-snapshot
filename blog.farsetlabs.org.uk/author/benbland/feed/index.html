<p>Fail fast, fail cheap.</p>
<p>Or is it &#8220;fail fast, fail often&#8221;?</p>
<p>On Saturday, 7 Nov we&#8217;re uniting with some of our friends, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/672534676155502/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Design Salon</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thepottingshedbelfast/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Potting Shed</a>, for an all-day event, as part of the first ever <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/" target="_blank">Belfast Design Week</a>. You&#8217;re invited to join us in a creative, hands-on, welcoming environment, as we all take the journey from idea to soup.</p>
<p>Event Summary: Sat 7 Nov 2015 // 10:00 until late (12:30 – 16:00 at Farset) // Register here: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast: Makers&#8217; Day Field Trip to Farset Labs</a> // It&#8217;s all FREE OF CHARGE.</p>
<p>Yes, soup. We will begin the day at The Hive, venture over to Farset in the afternoon, then end up back at The Hive for a pitching session, while we enjoy some hot refreshment with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/belfastsoupni?fref=ts" target="_blank">Belfast Soup</a>. Mmm, soup.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll all go to the pub. Mmm, beer.</p>
<p>That Saturday of Design Week is designated as Makers&#8217; Day so roll up your sleeves and come f*@k things up with us. You don&#8217;t need to consider yourself a designer or maker to get value out of the day. It&#8217;s a good chance to make some smart, creative friends and take part in the fascinating process of developing ideas.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the planned Itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:00 – 12:00: The Potting Shed @The Hive : Bring your new or existing idea to the Potting Shed team and get their multidisciplinary input on how to make it happen or bring it to its full potential.</li>
<li>12.30: Walk from The Hive to Farset Labs.</li>
<li>13:00 – 16:00: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast</a> @ Farset Labs: taking the ideas and designing prototypes to see how they might function in reality.</li>
<li>16:00: Walk back from Farset Labs to The Hive.</li>
<li>17:00 – 19:00: Belfast Soup @ The Hive: Buy some soup and pitch your ideas for the chance to win some startup money to make it happen!</li>
<li>19:00 – Collapse: Drinks at The Sunflower.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/events/2015/11/7/makers-day" target="_blank">here</a> is the official page and links to register for other parts of the day.</p>
<p>For our part, we&#8217;re going to focus on that challenging step in the creative process where you have to get your idea out of your head and into the world so it can be given a chance to fail. During the workshop we&#8217;ll talk about what prototyping involves, and look at the recent revolution in rapid prototyping, assisted by technologies like 3D printers and the internet. Then we&#8217;ll stop talking and play – making simple prototypes with paper and pen and whatever we have to hand.</p>
<p>You can come to all or just part of the day&#8217;s events. Or just meet us in the pub in the evening. Mmm beer. There&#8217;s no charge but please register if you&#8217;re coming so we know the numbers. And we&#8217;re seeking techie, creative and communicative people to be in the room to help facilitate progress – please <a href="mailto:ben.m.bland@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you can help.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re calling it FailFast to resurrect an old project that never got much momentum. I guess you could say it failed, rather fast. But that&#8217;s the whole point. There&#8217;s a popular sentiment in the entrepreneurial world that failure is a big part of innovation and creativity. So much so that it has become trendy. Most ideas don&#8217;t grow into anything substantial. Most startups collapse. The important thing is to try – develop your idea, get your prototype out into the world, see if it works and iterate on its development, and do so as quickly and cheaply as possible. It will probably fail so if you want something to succeed, fail fast, fail cheap and fail often. So yeh, we&#8217;re calling it FailFast.</p>
<p>Oh, and it rhymes with Belfast. Sort of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitisation is transforming our world and it is the communities of curious, creative people – like those who gather in makerspaces – who are best-placed to thrive after the dust settles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2555"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit.png" alt="The Maker Revolution" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fist_Revolution_Edit-1024x1024.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Update: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/benbland/digital-darwinism-creativity-in-the-third-industrial-revolution-farset-labs-makerspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link to presentation slides on SlideShare</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friends at the youth-led </span><a href="http://create.to/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference generously invited me to speak to their audience of a couple of hundred 16-18 year-olds last week. The offer triggered an instant drain on my free time as I tried to find some coherence in my thoughts on the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maker Movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I wanted to use this speaking slot as an Archimedes lever to dislodge the attendees from any traditional career plans and catapult them into the chaotic, creative world of exploring, tinkering and production that we love so much in communities like Farset Labs. But I would have settled for just sharing one big idea about the world that got them thinking in a new way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there is a big idea around at the moment that provides a context for the emergence of our new maker culture. And by big, I mean really, very, exceptionally big. Like world-changing, epoch-defining </span><b>big</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simply put, the idea is that we are in the midst of a global revolution that is taking us into a new socioeconomic era, and we have the opportunity to hack our way to a happy future.</span></p>
<p>Of course, we can’t know right now what this period will be called in future. Just as it might have sounded weird in 1850 to ask a friend, “how’s the Industrial Revolution going for you?” We can’t see it clearly from the inside. Leave it to historians to define past generations.</p>
<p>But we can get some perspective on our current situation. We can take the reference frame of human innovation over the course of our existence. Here’s a quick run through…</p>
<ul>
<li>5-7M yrs ago – our ancestral apes began to move out of the trees and into the African plains.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-3M yrs ago – we see the first signs of basic tools being made.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">~70,000 yrs ago – humans start to show evidence of specialisation in their hunter-gatherer practices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">~18,000 yrs ago – specialisation develops into the cultivation of crops and domestication of animals, launching the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agricultural Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (aka Neolithic Revolution). This gives birth to great phenomena such as large settlements, division of labour, hierarchical societies and religions, trading economies, and armies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late 18th Century – powered by inventions like the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spinning jenny</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steam engine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrial Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kicks off. People go to work in factories, from which emerge modern, hierarchical companies with new concepts like management. The human lifespan doubles and a new middle class emerges. We enter the Industrial Era and again the world changes forever.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">1950s–now – computers and the internet underpin the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the world goes from </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2014/02/10/more-1876-than-1995/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">atoms to bits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are now in the Information Era, characterised by the democratisation of communication, connection and knowledge resources.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Welcome to the Third Industrial Revolution</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarise the above timeline in another way, we can say that there have been three transitions between major economic epochs in human history<sup>1</sup>: 1) foraging to horticulture, 2) horticulture to agriculture, and 3) agriculture to industrialisation. And within the last stage, there have been three industrial revolutions: the one we call </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Industrial Revolution (late 18th to early 20th Century), the Digital Revolution (1950s to now), and finally the, err, well, we’re not sure what to call it yet…</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557" style="width: 1440px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Neil-Gershenfeld-Quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2557"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2557 size-full" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Neil-Gershenfeld-Quote.png" alt="Neil Gershenfeld Quote" width="1440" height="1078" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Neil-Gershenfeld-Quote.png 1440w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Neil-Gershenfeld-Quote-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Neil-Gershenfeld-Quote-1024x767.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-caption-text">A quote from Neil Gershenfeld, Director, The Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT and founder of Fab Labs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest revolution, if we just assume that’s what we can call it, is essentially a combination of its Industrial and Digital ancestors. We went from atoms to bits, now we’re swinging back, as the atoms themselves become the new bits. In other words, where the digital world brought the costs of publishing, communication and learning down to the level of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discretionary income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the same thing is now happening with the tools of production.</span></p>
<p>Think of the costs (of all sorts: money, time, expertise, etc.) required to go from having an idea, to selling a product in a global market, just 15 years ago. Even if you could have designed the product yourself, you might have needed to pay a hefty fee for the software to do so. Making a first prototype would typically have cost tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds, which you would probably have needed to source from banks or other traditional investors. And all that, before you have even tried to take your product into the market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the cost of access to manufacturing tools is often around 1/10,000th<sup>2</sup> what it was just 10-15 years ago. And to learn the craft of using those tools often takes weeks now, not years. The journey from idea to global product business in this new paradigm might look something like this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design prototype with free software, like Google’s </span><a href="http://www.sketchup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SketchUp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build prototype in a makerspace, or send the design to a single-run manufacturing service, such as </span><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shapeways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.ponoko.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ponoko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (for pocket-money prices).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to a crowdfunding platform (eg. </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kickstarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) for early production and development costs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use an online service like </span><a href="http://www.alibaba.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to connect with a manufacturer in the Far East, firing-up their facilities and running-out the first few 1,000.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bring the product back to home soil, collaborating with high quality local manufacturers, to customise and produce the next few 10s of 1,000s.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe head back out to Asia now, for mass-production in the 100,000s and beyond.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retire or go back to 1.</span></li>
</ol>
<figure id="attachment_2556" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2556" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Altman-Quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2556"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2556 size-full" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Altman-Quote.png" alt="Quote by Mitch Altman" width="720" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Altman-Quote.png 720w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Altman-Quote-200x300.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Altman-Quote-683x1024.png 683w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2556" class="wp-caption-text">Mitch Altman, a hacker hero and no obvious capitalist, connects the joy of creative expression with the opportunities it can offer us.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Digital Revolution democratised connection, now affordable tools are democratising manufacturing too. The machinery available, of which the poster children have been 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC machines, allow us to operate from the nanoscale up to the size of buildings. Now almost anything that can be imagined can be built by ordinary people. This is a first for our species and planet, there is no precedent or rulebook to employ here.</span></p>
<p>The rising popularity of hacking and making may be a response to this new environment and is certainly an avenue to benefitting from the opportunities it presents. That is not to say we should all focus on saleable products, it is just as much about play, artistry and education. Communities are forming all over the world, united by the childlike joy that is felt when we are able to explore our curiosity and make things – to express ourselves in creative ways. We are grouping together, sharing ideas and seeking places in which we can interact and collaborate. Makerspaces and hackerspaces are nodes in this rapidly growing global network. Three years ago, before our members assembled and launched Farset Labs out of their own pockets, it felt like Northern Ireland was missing the revolution. It felt like Farset needed to exist.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At time of writing, </span><a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackerspaces.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lists nearly 2,000 locations worldwide. And those are just the ones who self-identify with the “hacker” label and have been added to the list. We can assume there are many more venues and groups that exist under the broad definition of hackerspace, makerspace, hackspace and so on – and let’s not get into </span><a href="http://makezine.com/2013/05/22/the-difference-between-hackerspaces-makerspaces-techshops-and-fablabs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the name issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.</span></p>
<h3><b>Digital Darwinism</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the Maker Movement seems to be a response to, or a result of, the shift from one socioeconomic epoch to another. An obvious analogy to this concept is the response of species to changing environments. When an asteroid smashed into Earth 65M years ago, triggering a global extinction event that ended the reign of the dinosaurs, it was our small, furry ancestors who seized control of the food chain. They were better suited to survive in the new climate that suddenly engulfed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolutionary analogies are popular in this context. In what can be called </span><a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/04/digital-darwinism-disruptive-technology-changing-business-good/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Darwinism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, organisations are seeking strategies for becoming more adaptable as their world changes, and does so at an accelerating pace. A statistic that possibly highlights this process is the falling lifespan of companies. A popular </span><a href="http://www.innosight.com/innovation-resources/strategy-innovation/creative-destruction-whips-through-corporate-america.cfm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by Richard Foster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, of Yale University and Innosight, showed that companies on the S&amp;P 500 Index had an average lifespan of 61 years back in 1958, which came down to 25 years by 1980, and 18 years by the time of the study, in 2012. He and his associates put this down to what economists call </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creative destruction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which species will survive and thrive in a future where digital manufacturing – and who knows what next – is placed in the hands of the masses? “Survival of the fittest” is the catchphrase of Darwinian evolution, but it’s a bit of a curse on Darwin’s actual theory. The idea of &#8220;fitness&#8221; can be mistaken for something like strength, speed and agility, when it’s supposed to mean “better designed for an immediate, local environment”<sup>3</sup>.</span></p>
<p>Better suited to the post-revolutionary world is somebody who can not only change her behaviours to meet the challenges of the new environment and exploit its opportunities, but can also make change itself one of her capabilities. We don’t know when the next revolution will occur or what it might involve. But take another look at the timeline above – it’s striking how the periods between each revolutionary event shrink exponentially as history plays out. Likewise, the time taken for each change to run its course is much shorter each time. If change itself is a shifting problem, we should make adaptation part of our fitness regime.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovative adaptability in a world of accelerating change requires a curious mind and a creative spirit. Those who make and share things become learners and teachers simply by their actions, and they do so more effectively when they are together, in communities like ours. Their passion for new and interesting things could be their greatest strength.</span></p>

<p>With my imminent departure for Nicaragua looming, I have the immense honour of welcoming Conor Robinson as our new incoming director, having been voted-in by the community. Conor, congratulations and welcome to the fray. I did a little air-punch when I saw that Conor had registered for election. Now Farset is getting an upgrade: replacing its most aged part with a new, faster, more functional one.</p>
<p>I have for years referred to myself as a &#8220;wannabe geek&#8221; to avoid anyone thinking that I actually know how to do anything technical. And, well, Conor&#8217;s one of those guys who does. But directing an experimental organisation like ours needs much more than tech credentials, and I think Conor brings the full set of tools to the table. He&#8217;s calm, friendly, organised (or at least he looks like he is because he&#8217;s always carrying a notebook!), and damn smart.</p>
<p>As Conor steps-up, I am stepping, well, kinda sideways. Quite a way actually. 8,341.14km in fact. I hope you will forgive my self-indulgence at taking this opportunity not only say hello to our new director, but also to offer some thoughts from a parting one. You know, like the private note the old president traditionally leaves for the new one&#8230; except it&#8217;s public. And not in the White House. And probably not as useful.<br />
<span id="more-1858"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4>Remember You&#8217;re a Director, not a Manager</h4>
<p>Your limited time in this life is priceless. Of every minute you can spare to help the cause, keep the long-term objectives in mind and try to steer this ship with nudges here and there. You&#8217;re aiming on an approximate course towards a bigger goal, rather than getting bogged-down by other people&#8217;s demands, little niggles, emptying bins, and all manner of bureaucratic chaff.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t forget the details. Sometimes they make all the difference.</p>
<p>A director, I think, should have a clear vision. I have my own idea of what Farset could and should be in future. Each of my colleagues on the team has a personal idea too. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap and no shortage of deviation. Conor, I invite you to design your own vision before you get spoiled by familiarity. Hold it close when things get messy.</p>
<h4>Reinforce The Positive</h4>
<p>When it comes to motivating people, it seems that the science stands in favour of reward over punishment. <a href="http://allpsych.com/psychology101/reinforcement.html">Positive reinforcement beats negative reinforcement</a>. So get behind those who help, shine a light on them. Incentivise and reward the pro-social, hold fast against the anti-social.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. And when something seems to work, it might have just been luck. Try to test and measure, try to understand the data. But in the end, you&#8217;ll never truly know what made the difference so don&#8217;t worry about it. When you look back <a href="http://irrco.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/why-punishment-is-better-than-praise/">the outcome was probably just Regression to the Mean</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, it&#8217;s nice to be nice.</p>
<h4>Nurture the Friendships</h4>
<p>Some high-flyers on the West Coast say that the worst thing you can do as a business founder is hire your friends. But those people will die lonely and disappointed in their overpriced homes. OK, so I&#8217;d concede that it makes sense to build a team of the best people possible and avoid nepotism on grounds of convenience or selfish aims. But I&#8217;d rather run into the unknown with people I can call in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some dear friends at Farset and now I can trust them to tell me when I&#8217;m being an idiot, without causing offence. Better still, I know they&#8217;ll cut me slack when my faults slow us down. Above all, I know I have their support, and they mine, if we go on to launch any more moonshots in the future.</p>
<h4>Hack Your Way</h4>
<p>We are constantly trying to figure-out how to make this work. Just when we get something nailed down, someone gets the bright idea to take it apart and turn it into something else. The processes, guidelines, lessons and resources, form a constantly shifting sea through which you can try to navigate but will never reach the other shore. There are best practices, not just from the global hacker/maker community (who will help if you ask them) but from wider industry and society. But sometimes you just have to deal with things when they happen. So hack the process. It&#8217;s a project in itself. And, like any good engineer, please do a better job than me at documenting your progress!</p>
<h4>And Lastly, Don&#8217;t Listen to Ben</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always advised people of this point, on which I feel quite strongly: people who have strong opinions and give confident advice probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The world is a strange, and strangely complex, complexly beautifully place. Running a venture that is novel, technologically &amp; creatively pioneering, and built on an eclectic, slightly anarchic crowd of fabulously smart and weird people, probably doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re all confident that Conor will be a great asset to the organisation and its members. He&#8217;s been on the Farset scene since it was just an idea so he knows the score. It will, I&#8217;m sure, take a little time to settle into a productive rhythm. Soon enough it will become clear where to be of most use. Everyone else will pick up the rest.</p>
<p>You know what Mitch Altman and the guys at <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">or for that matter Bill &amp; Ted</a>) would say: be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>Buena suerte Conor, y hasta luego todos mis amigos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Borg_Home_0021.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Borg_Home_0021.jpg" alt="Internet of Things" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a>, it&#8217;s gonna be epic. Wait, no, it&#8217;s already here. But it&#8217;s gonna be cooler next year, right?</p>
<p>The connected world has been shifting from bits to atoms for a while and it feels like we&#8217;re finally riding over the edge of a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a> of connected tools and systems that could reshape every sector of life. Or maybe not, maybe that&#8217;s just starry-eyed confirmation bias. We&#8217;ve spoken with a lot of people in the last few months about how to stay on top of the Internet of Things (&#8220;IoT&#8221;) movement.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to figure-out what the right level of discussion and engagement is for Northern Ireland&#8217;s part in the revolution. So earlier this month we got a few good people around the benches in the sunshine outside the Labs to move things forward. Below are some disjointed notes following that session. Better to think out loud.<br />
<span id="more-1757"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re planning a series of events around this and would love comments on how to get the most out of them. Also how to create that value in tandem with other events and projects, such as the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/IOTBelfast/">IoT Belfast meetup</a>, and next month&#8217;s Enterprise Forum, where our friends at <a href="http://nispconnect.org">NISP CONNECT</a> are hosting our friends from Intel to present <a href="http://www.nisp.co.uk/nisp-connect-enterprise-forum-presents-intels-vision-for-the-internet-of-things/">Intel&#8217;s vision for the IoT</a>.</p>
<p>Our next session will be at <strong>18:00 Weds 13 Aug</strong>, down here at Farset: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iot-hack-creative-tinkering-knowledge-sharing-around-the-internet-of-things-tickets-12371372107">IoT Hack – Creative Tinkering &amp; Knowledge Sharing around the Internet of Things</a>. Join us.</p>
<h3>Notes from our Discussion:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Definition:</b> what can we agree that <i>Internet of Things</i> actually means? What does it include/exclude? Is there a better or more appropriate name? I think saying &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; in ten years will sound like it does now if you call the internet the &#8220;Information Superhighway&#8221;.</li>
<li><b>Standards:</b> open standards; proprietary solutions such as Android vs Apple.</li>
<li><b>Unexplored territory:</b> a lot is happening in a few areas (eg. home and fitness), where is there an unsolved need? What sectors might converge into clusters in future (ie. Biology + Technology is now Biotech), maybe agriculture + connected architecture, or personalised healthcare + medical devices?</li>
<li><b>The NI angle:</b> identifying the greatest opportunities on home turf, such as finding existing talent and resources; playing to NI&#8217;s strengths such as agriculture and the public sector. Who are the local IoT innovators? What are the local needs?</li>
<li><b>Session format:</b> potentially aim to have something out of each session, such as a blackboard prototype; have people present problems that we can try to solve in the room.</li>
</ol>
<p>This IoT thing is a big field. Much bigger than us.<a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/blog-post-internet-of-things-discussion-roundup/529" target="_blank"> We invite anyone to join the conversation</a> or, better still, help stimulate activities in Northern Ireland and hack our way into a leading position in the global IoT sector. There are many different pieces to this but together I&#8217;m sure we can connect them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summer can be either be downtime or uptime for kids, families and businesspeople alike. For our members who volunteer to run <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> at <a>Farset Labs</a> it could have been a good time to chill out. But noooooo, they&#8217;ve only gone and made more work for themselves.</p>
<p>This July and August, bring your kids to Farset Labs to learn their choice of the following, in four weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and program a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313">LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot</a>. The robot was part of the kit kindly donated to Farset by the <a href="http://nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre</a> for just this kind of hands-on learning. Well, it&#8217;s not just about the learning, right? It&#8217;s the errr&#8230;. Robots! <strong>UPDATE: LEGO sessions were booked-out in a couple of hours! Sorry. Hannah is taking names for more LEGO sessions in September, just email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></strong></li>
<li>Design a working computer game with <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>.</li>
<li>Design and build a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal CoderDojo will resume in September. See the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html">calendar for details</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand, while we have your attention, it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone that Farset has no public funding and is run by volunteers. No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/FL_DjSummer">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here</a>.</p>
<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer. I stayed up to the wee hours putting that abomination together. It&#8217;s MY abomination and I&#8217;m proud of it.</i></p>

<p>As ever, we&#8217;re keen for people to raise their hands either as speakers or audience. If you&#8217;ve never been to one of our GoL nights before, it&#8217;s an easy intro to the community. Past talks have ranged from Quantum Physics to baking, and from wearable tech to beer. And if you have something you can condense into seven minutes that might prick the interest of a geeky, creative group – let us know.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gathering-of-lightning-tickets-11832099127">register here</a> so we know how much beer and pizza to get.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be beer and pizza&#8230;</p>
<p>Details: Thurs 5 June, from 18:00</p>

<p>Yes folks, 2014 is Belfast&#8217;s first year hosting a <a title="Big Data Week Belfast" href="http://bigdataweek.com/belfast/" target="_blank">Big Data Week</a>, brought to us by our buddies at <a title="Analytics Engines" href="http://analyticsengines.com" target="_blank">Analytics Engines</a>. And we have the privilege of holding the last event in the series, at 18:00 on Fri 9 May. Anyone with a techie interest is welcome. There&#8217;ll be content for all knowledge levels and of course we&#8217;ll wrap-up in good time with some beer and snacks.</p>
<p>Speakers and content are being discussed at the moment but we&#8217;ve plenty lined-up so far, from educational tutorials to a lighter take on the dark side of data. This is a good chance to learn about the big data movement and debate the validity and impact of the trend.</p>
<p>Feel free to jump in on the <a title="Big Data Week on Discourse" href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/big-data-week-at-farset-5th-9th-may/333/7" target="_blank">discussion on our Discourse forum</a> ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Other events are running at different venues between 7 and 9 May, with the main show being the Big Data Insights Conference at <a title="Titanic Belfast" href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/" target="_blank">Titanic Belfast</a> all day on the Wednesday. More at <a title="Big Data Week Belfast" href="http://bigdataweek.com/belfast/" target="_blank">Big Data Week Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>All are welcome but please <a title="Big Data in Little Farset on GetInvited" href="https://getinvited.to/benbland/big-data-in-little-farset/" target="_blank">register FREE here</a> so we know you&#8217;re coming. And watch out for the Giro D&#8217;Italia road closures, including Gt Victoria St, which you can dodge by coming over to Sandy Row. Bloody cyclists, coming here, stealing our congestion!</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve run this crazy ship on the tireless input of a bunch of visionary volunteers. I am in a constant state of wonder and gratitude for this continued effort. Nobody asks for thanks in return but it&#8217;s always nice when the good karma pays off a little.</p>
<p>The <a title="Hello World Foundation" href="http://helloworldfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Hello World Foundation</a> is kindly sending us some free <a title="Raspberry Pi" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pis</a>! With these, we can do more not only to introduce kids to the power of coding, but also to become more familiar with the inner workings of computers and electronics, rather than seeing computers as impregnable black boxes.</p>
<p>The Foundation exists to create the world’s leading network of affiliated coding clubs for young people. It&#8217;s a new organisation, formed on the heels of <a title="CoderDojo" href="http://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> by the same organisation&#8217;s founder, Ireland&#8217;s own <a title="James Whelton" href="http://coderdojo.com/founders" target="_blank">James Whelton</a>. On behalf of the Farset Labs CoderDojo, thanks to you all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1502" alt="Intel &amp; Farset Logos" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos-300x1281.png" width="300" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to publicly announcee our new corporate member&#8230; [drum roll]&#8230; <a href="http://intel.ie">Intel</a>. Welcome to the family!</p>
<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world’s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.</p>
<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel’s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.</p>
<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said “Intel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.”</p>
<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company’s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014. Any suggestions would be very welcome – what would you like to do with Intel?</p>
<p><em>This and the launch of <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">GGJ14</a> are part of this months <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Farset_Jan_News_Pack.zip" target="_blank">Press Pack</a></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest project  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>
