										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">expansion, renovation, and improvement</a> of Farset Labs is nearly finished, with the project on schedule and anticipated to only slip by a few days, which will not materially affect our timetable. A range of purpose-built features for the Event Space, workshop, and general accessibility have been included. Fundraising to further our charitable aims has started and you can find out how to contact us about this at the end of the post. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How time flies &#8211; we’re nearing the end of our eight week build schedule on the Farset Labs renovation and the results are looking fantastic so far. Our <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">Victorian schoolhouse</a>, which has been educating Belfast since 1883, is nearly ready to open its doors again. While the timetable has slipped by a few days, we&#8217;re still on target to be <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2019/06/farset-labs-v2-expanding-renovating-improving/">back in by early October</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to take this opportunity to share a few select photos from the project so far, starting right back at the beginning… (Or you can skip right to the <a href="#current-progress">current progress</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The story so far&#8230;</h2>



<p>After our big push to vacate the building, the construction firm wasted no time in starting demolition, which reduced Unit 1 to a rather sorry state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t long before the mess was cleared up and Unit 1 was a blank canvas again (more or less).</p>

<p>The bulk of the structural work was confined to the eastern end of the building, where a lift shaft was formed and two pre-existing openings were sealed up, with a new, wider opening made.</p>

<p>Demolition wasn’t confined to downstairs, although a previous contractor had torn down most of the internal studs upstairs several months previously in preparation for the project &#8211; the below images were actually taken as part of a Farset survey in early March 2019. </p>

<p>Some say this was briefly the premier toilet in Weavers Court &#8211; excellent south facing aspect, glorious afternoon light, fine views over a converted Victorian mill, wonderful sense of spaciousness&#8230;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the summertime work: due to the floor settling unevenly at the western end over the last century and a half, the joiners moved in to rectify the problem.</p>

<p>The major stud walls upstairs were erected pretty early in the project.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg" alt="In the upstairs desk space, looking east." class="wp-image-3144" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164326-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The studs between the desk space upstairs and the kitchenette/meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see the marks for widening the doorway seen in the previous photo. We’re looking east, with the kitchenette through to the left and the meeting room through to the right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg" alt="The hallway on the first floor." class="wp-image-3145" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164345-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The position of the lift shaft (seen here on the left with copious quantities of two-by-four and marine ply) and the existing stairwell (coming up through the purple door on the right) meant the lobby area was a peculiar shape, which we decided to keep open and make into the new lounge area. This will be a chill-out space, a social space, or simply a place to take a phone call or lunch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg" alt="Lift shaft under construction, seen from the new lounge area." class="wp-image-3148" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164456-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Standing in the new lounge area</figcaption></figure>



<p>The new first floor meeting room under construction, before the studs on the left of the image were reinforced for a wall-mounted display. Note also the cabling for power and HDMI to the floor box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room, looking south." class="wp-image-3149" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190814_164734-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The upstairs meeting room</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back downstairs, we can see the little stud wall that was put in to provide power and support to the central workbench in the workshop. Originally, we had envisaged the power simply coming down the column, but solid iron is, of course, not the best material to work on for that purpose, so a heavily reinforced (almost all two-by-fours and ply) stud was built instead.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg" alt="Workshop stud wall in Farset Labs" class="wp-image-3150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190823_175616-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Using a reinforced little stud wall to avoid having to work on the iron column</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the other end of the building, I returned from a trip away to a conference to find that the upstairs kitchenette and lift had seemingly appeared out of nowhere &#8211; appearances were deceiving, though, since most of the internals of the lift were still being worked on. Accessibility has been a very important consideration during this renovation, and a number of features have gone or are going into the building in order to help our users.</p>

<p><strong>These accessibility features include</strong>, but are not limited to: twin fire refuge points with two-way firefighter’s comms, installing distress call points in both disabled toilets, a new disabled toilet on the first floor, built to be compliant with the latest regulations, a high-contrast colour scheme throughout the Labs (high LRV differentials) to aid the navigation of visually impaired users, braille signage and wayfinding*, induction loops in the Event Space and meeting room*, drop-level workbenches in the workshop for wheelchair access to an electronics workstation, spaces such as the lounge area for users to decompress and avoid sensory overload, dual electric blinds for dimming rooms to different levels*, high CRI and lower colour temperature LED lighting to avoid fatigue and migraines from fluorescents/CFLs, hold-open fire doors to allow the option of door-free entry from street to the Event Space when an event is starting, and levelling and refitting nearly 4,000 sq ft of flooring, including the use of low-rolling resistance, healthcare-grade vinyl in the ground floor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="current-progress">Current Progress</h2>



<p>Finally, these most up-to-date images were all taken on one recent evening and should give an idea of the progress:</p>



<p>We start in the team room on the first floor, at the very western end of the building (we’re standing in the north-western corner) &#8211; the western fire escape is to the left. Unfortunately, though we fought for it, the beautiful ceiling is being covered up again by a new suspended ceiling. Perhaps something to return to in a future project.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking south-east." class="wp-image-3111" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170406-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>View of the same room from the opposite corner. This room will be our area for small teams, whether hobbyist or professional. Members can rent several desks and work together on projects, enjoying a higher degree of privacy and an included small meeting pod* (sited in the alcove visible here).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Team Room, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_170804-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving into the next room, we can see the desk space, with eight large windows providing some really beautiful natural light throughout the day. The next image is the same view, but moved right slightly, standing in the door of the team room, and the final image is from the opposite end, looking west towards the doorway the previous image was taken in. There will be circa twenty desks in here, arranged with comfortable room all around, and also a couple of telephone booths*, print services, and storage.</p>

<p>Facing south, we find ourselves in the meeting room, now with the plasterboard on, which will have a large monitor for presentations, teleconferencing kit for collaboration*, and space for up to seven people to meet privately…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Meeting Room" class="wp-image-3117" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171258-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>…and facing north, across the corridor, we can see the kitchenette, just before the piping for the boiler was boxed in.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs first floor kitchenette" class="wp-image-3118" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171327-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Going through the door at the end of the short corridor, in the lounge area, we can also glimpse the lift cabin being worked on at that moment in time. Through the doorway on the left is the toilets, cleaning cupboard, and electrical services for the floor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs lounge/first floor lobby, with a view of the lift being worked on." class="wp-image-3119" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171358-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The furthest wall that you can see, to the left of the window, will have shelving for our library of texts, classic gaming collection, magazines, and a large screen. The shelving will continue around into the alcove to the left (out of view) and there is hope a fish tank will also be included here, as a donation of materials and time from a member with previous experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving the camera round the corner to the right, with the lift to our back left, we get a better look at that alcove and the door to the main stairwell.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs lounge area." class="wp-image-3120" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_171433-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Standing on the landing, we can see the entrances to both floors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172311-768x1024.jpg" alt="View from the landing between the ground and first floors of Farset Labs.

<p>Coming down the stairs, we’re now in the new front doorway, which has become the entrance for both units. We hope to have mail-handling facilities on the left wall and ahead, in what will soon be behind a door, you can see part of the Tibus gear which provides our awesome internet connectivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs new main entrance hallway for both floors." class="wp-image-3122" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_172428-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The new entrance for both floors</figcaption></figure>



<p>Walking past the ground floor lift lobby and into what was the old co-working space, the camera finds itself in the south western corner, where the networking cabinet used to sit. The alcove to right and the wall on the other side of the entrance hallway will both have lockers* for member storage installed in them. It is our current intention to fabricate some desk-level benches in the middle of the room and at the windows, offering comfortable and generous hotdesking space with power sockets and proper seating. Note the much higher plastered ceiling throughout the ground floor, exposing the beautiful ironwork and central wooden beam, which gives the whole space a very light and airy feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg" alt="View of the old co-working (new hot-desking) space in Farset Labs, which will also feature member storage." class="wp-image-3124" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174111-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The hot-desking space, which will also feature member storage</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve considerably widened our Event Space door, both for general people flow and for improved accessibility. Turning left through it, we can see the new Event Space, which has been enlarged by ~40%, giving considerably more usable space and flexibility than that figure would suggest. This will be kitted out with brand new tables with a non-folding tabletop, and brand new durable moulded chairs with cushions. Both the tables and chairs have been specified to include high-capacity trolley storage and the new store (alcove on the right of the image, waiting for double doors to be fitted) will hold the entire table and chair stock, allowing the Event Space to be completely empty, enhancing its capability as a multi-use space, particularly in light of plans to also integrate room-scale VR facilities into it*. Retractable drop-down power sockets for desk groups will be installed* to eliminate trailing cables and speed up setup time. We also have exciting plans* for best-in class AV to allow our members and external users, such as meet-up groups, access to a unique, highly specified facility.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking north-west." class="wp-image-3125" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174159-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moving to the other side of the Event Space, we can see that it now has own-door access from the car park, allowing event organisers to welcome guests directly into the space in good weather. (Industrial clean-off carpet will be fitted at this and other entrances to prevent ingress of water/dirt.) The window to the workshop sits just beside it, allowing a connection between the two core rooms of the hackerspace. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs Event Space, looking south-west." class="wp-image-3126" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_174216-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The workshop is completely new, with sealed lighting fixtures, a large cored external hole for air extraction, emergency cut-off panic switches on sockets, a dedicated 20A supply for a down-draught vented 1,200°C+ <strong>kiln</strong>*, the same for a 4’ x 2’ <strong>CNC router</strong> with fourth axis*, space for a large (~1000mm x 600mm) <strong>laser cutter</strong> with dual (CO2 and MOPA fibre) diodes*, a Formlabs Form 3 <strong>3D Printer</strong> with wash and cure*, a large industrial sink with waste filtration (allowing, for example, ceramics work), FDM <strong>3D printers</strong>, a <strong>pedestal drill</strong>, a smaller <strong>CNC mill</strong> (Nomad 883 Pro)*, smaller <strong>laser cutter</strong> (Glowforge Pro)*, desktop <strong>vacuum former</strong>*, <strong>screen printer</strong>*, <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong>*, high quality hand tools, an industrial <strong>sewing machine</strong> &amp; overlocker*, computerised <strong>embroidery machine</strong>*, <strong>tailor’s form</strong>*, <strong>steam iron</strong>*, and two electronics workstations, with a <strong>reflow oven</strong>*, high-end <strong>Oscilloscopes</strong>*, bench top <strong>PSUs</strong>*, bench top <strong>multimeters</strong>*, <strong>microscopy</strong>*, <strong>PCB shear</strong>*, Weller <strong>solder/desolder stations</strong>*, Weller hot-air <strong>rework station</strong>*, and more. Whew!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg" alt="Farset Labs workshop, looking north-east, towards the Event Space." class="wp-image-3127" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190906_175149-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Workshop &#8211; note the window to the Event Space</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, moving to the right, we get a view of the dedicated fire escape/separate entrance for the workshop, the new boiler room access door, and the aforementioned cored hole for extraction services. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that the philosophy for the workshop is to allow the creation of objects anywhere up to about a metre cubed, whether as prototypes, art, or whatever our members can imagine. We have placed a heavy emphasis on precision engineering and end-to-end electronics fabrication.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At the ripe old age of seven, we're moving. But only for a while...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been over seven years since Northern Ireland&#8217;s hackerspace <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/03/launch-day-hackathon/">opened its doors</a> to the artists, engineers, and makers of Belfast. Farset Labs has spent that time delivering <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html">STEAM education</a>, providing a <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">space and tools</a> for the tech and creative scene, and being a focal point for <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/">events and meetups</a>. We&#8217;ve had a blast, and grown immensely, both as an organisation and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; as a community.</p>



<p>Many will have noticed that, over the past couple of years, it&#8217;s been getting rather cosy in Unit 1, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/77D8eZ1LK49cmRRF8">our home</a> in Weavers Court Business Park. There&#8217;s just not <em>quite</em> enough room for everyone, the event space is regularly used for overflow from the co-working space, and the workshop is, well, regularly used for overflow from the event space!</p>



<p>We do, however, have some news to share (and some awkward weeks ahead of us).</p>



<p>In the middle of November last year, we got word from our landlord that the other tenants in building, who occupied the first floor, were departing and we were asked if we wanted to take it on. This scenario had been long discussed within the Farset Labs team, but now we had first refusal on occupying the entire building. </p>



<p>While the thought of more than doubling our floorspace was a daunting one, we sharpened our pencils and kicked off the due diligence, and have been working with the team at Weavers Court for the last eight months to bring this dream to reality.</p>



<p>After many, <em>many</em> delays, complications, surveyors, consultations, and long weekends of planning, shuffling, and boxing, we&#8217;ve set in motion both the biggest and riskiest manoeuvre that the charity has attempted yet. </p>



<p>The next few months are going to see major changes happening at your community hackerspace, as we begin a programme of renovations and expansion that will stand us in good stead for the next eight years and beyond. Our current location, <strong>Unit 1, will be shut to members</strong> in the coming weeks and <strong>completely emptied by Friday 19th July</strong>, while our new temporary premises, <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A9TP1Waz369omwRm8">Unit 5E</a>, will be available for use from the week beginning Monday 1st July. </strong></p>



<p>We hope to take possession of Unit 1 again in late September and, following a period of internal fit out, have it <strong>fully open</strong> <strong>again in Early October</strong>. We know that this will cause disruption to many of the usual activities that take place in Farset Labs, but we are seeking to minimise the impact where possible, and Farset Labs will remain open throughout, though in a substantially smaller space</p>



<p>We’re very excited to share the new space with the community and if you’d like to know more about what is planned, please read on.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Further information:</strong></p>



<p>The renovation and expansion of the hackerspace is a large project that involves Farset Labs more than doubling its floor space by taking possession of the unit above us, making us the sole tenants of our beloved old Victorian schoolhouse, just five minutes from Great Victoria Street and on the doorstep of Weavers Cross, the new transport hub.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3093" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSCF4588_noVRMs-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Our building, which was once used as the schoolhouse for the old linen mill</figcaption></figure>



<p>This gives us the opportunity to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Provide up to <strong>40 additional dedicated desk spaces</strong> upstairs in a bright and airy environment</li><li><strong>Expand our workshop</strong>, adding a new fire exit and access control</li><li><strong>Increase the size of our flexible event space</strong> and improve AV facilities</li><li>Create a <strong>new multipurpose space </strong>suited for art projects, teams, startups etc</li><li>Move the lounge upstairs and create a <strong>new dedicated meeting room</strong></li><li>Add <strong>call booths</strong>*, a second kitchenette, and additional toilets upstairs</li><li>Provide <strong>lift access</strong> to the new floor so everyone can use it</li><li>Finally, we will now have a <strong>single, unified entrance</strong> hallway for both floors</li></ul>



<p>There are many other small tweaks and additions, too numerous to list here, from new bench tops in the ground floor kitchenette, to improved sound proofing between floors, and furniture storage for the event space.</p>



<p>This improved canvas has also prompted us to reevaluate the equipment and facilities in the space. Since we’ll be redistributing member storage spaces from the workshop to across the building, we can now access-control the workshop and certain tools within it. This means training will be required to enter it, and further training will be required to energise and use certain tools, which will enable us to accommodate more advanced equipment and processes than we’ve been able to support so far.</p>



<p>We have identified the following as priorities and will be seeking further input from the wider community soon on shaping this list:</p>



<ul><li>New workshop equipment:<ul><li>Small laser cutter*</li><li>Small vacuum former</li><li>Small CNC router*</li><li>Benchtop small lathe*</li><li>FDM and SLA/DLP/LCD 3D Printers*</li><li>Benchtop power supplies*</li><li>Oscilloscopes</li><li>Logic analyser*</li><li>PCB stereo microscope</li><li>Dust and fume extraction</li><li>Heavy duty sewing machine</li><li>Hot wire cutter*<br /></li></ul></li><li>Event space:<ul><li>Updated ultra-bright projection*</li><li>1.2kW RMS surround sound system</li><li>Event recording/streaming equipment*</li><li>New lighting and backdrop options<br /></li></ul></li><li>Elsewhere:<ul><li>New information displays</li><li>Access control throughout</li><li>Systems for smart management of heating, lighting etc in the space</li><li>Teleconferencing facilities</li><li>New plants and eco friendly features</li><li>Fixtures for displaying art and member projects</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This list is not exhaustive and is dependent on reaching our target level of funding (items highlighted by an asterisk* indicate inclusion in our fundraising drive).</p>



<p>Accessibility was a key consideration in this expansion, and despite many difficulties with providing it in the structure of the old building, <strong>a lift will be installed</strong> to allow wheelchair/reduced mobility access to all spaces. In addition, key doors are being replaced and widened, improving flow throughout the space for all users. Certain doors, where possible, will also be electromagnetically held to eliminate the need to open them.</p>



<p>The new spaces have been designed to make it as easy as possible for members with accessibility needs to access them, with Farset Labs providing high contrast surfaces, induction loops, and Braille signage where possible. We remain firm in our commitment that people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds should be able to enjoy our space, and we are doing our best to provide this within our means.</p>



<p><strong>(Presumptive) FAQs</strong>:</p>



<p><em>I have stuff in Farset, what’s gonna happen to it?</em><br />All member storage boxes will still be available in our new, temporary location, Unit 5E and will be moved over with the rest of the equipment and furniture. If your stuff isn’t in a box, you can either collect it or let us know what you would like done with it via email or Slack.</p>



<p><em>What’s going to happen to [insert event or programme here]?</em><br />We’re going to try our best to keep “Minimum Viable Farset” going in the time being, but that’s going to be mostly co-working/hot-desking, as we’re moving from 2000 sq. ft over multiple rooms, to circa 600 sq. ft over a single room. We’ve shut down the CoderDojo for summer, as well as a few other regular events, and we won’t be taking most new event bookings for the period that we’re in our temporary location. However, these will all be coming back after the move!<br /></p>



<p><em>Who’s paying for all this?</em><br />The reason for the major renovation is related to the building (which hasn’t been fully renovated in about thirty years), rather than our tenancy, so the work being done to the fabric of the building is within the purview of the landlord (although they’ve kindly integrated some of our ideas and requests into the building plans). As for all the office furnishings, decoration, equipment, etc, we’ll be using core funds for that from members dues, so it’s still “our” space. However, we want to do this right, so we’ll be raising funds to make the transition as smooth as possible, and leave us with the best space we can manage.</p>



<p><em>What’s the network like in 5E?</em><br />We’ve worked with our good friends at <a href="https://www.tibus.com/connectivity-solutions/tibus-ultrafast-internet/">Tibus</a> to make sure it’s <em>almost</em> as awesome as the connection in Unit 1. A couple of years ago, we invested in some additional FTTC equipment as part of the <a href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/belfast-invites-new-businesses-get-super-connected">Super Connected Communities</a> programme and we won’t be able to migrate that over with us to our temporary location, so it’s not exactly the same, but it&#8217;s still a very solid and performant connection.</p>



<p><em>How is access going to work in Unit 5E?</em><br />We will be fitting a mechanical code lock this week and distributing the sequence to members, so access will be largely the same as in Unit 1 once it is set up. </p>



<p><em>How is this expansion going to effect membership dues?</em><br />We hope it won’t directly, however, we haven’t changed membership dues in over five years, so as part of the “settling in” period, we’ll be consulting with the membership on the charity&#8217;s cashflows and revenue calculations, so that we can make decisions about the long term sustainability of the community together.</p>



<p>One of the major motivations for the expansion is to increase the number of hackers, makers, and breakers that we can accommodate, and this increase in membership will offset the increased rent/electricity/heating costs so that Farset Labs can continue to be core-funded by the community</p>



<p><strong>Further questions?</strong></p>



<p>Please direct any enquiries to <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> or to @managers on the <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Labs Slack</a> and we will be happy to answer them. We have been trying to keep members updated through our Town Hall meetings and external event organisers updated via email, but if you have any specific concerns, please get in touch.</p>

<p>What is a hackerspace?</p>



<p>Scattered around the world each one is unique and means something different to each individual member.</p>



<p>In the autumn of 2015, I first visited Farset Labs and the very same week was my first as a member. It has been almost three years, yet I still find it hard to describe Farset. What about you?</p>



<p>One thing I know is that I have been to no other place like it. A place where anyone is welcome to experiment, teach, share ideas, unjustifiably set things on fire, watch opera and everything in between.</p>



<p>In Farset I met many people that I am glad to call friends. It is because of you that I discovered so many ideas and had the opportunity to realise new-found aspirations.</p>



<p>In Farset I met people with whom I share the principles of unbiased exchange of ideas and knowledge. Together we echo the same principles to our local communities in the form of clubs, meetups and mentorship of those on earlier stages of similar paths.</p>



<p>Each year I try to make a snowballing contribution to my community through building upon the experiences of years past.</p>



<p>&#8211; Helping at charity shops taught me the value of investing time<br />&#8211; Helping at Coder Dojo, Raspberry JAM and volunteering at events taught me the value of inspiring future successors<br />&#8211; Organizing my own kids&#8217; coding club with Code Club taught me the value of reaching out to communities outside our own<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing Code Co-Op and designing programming challenges taught me the value of peership and collaboration<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing NIDevConf18 taught me the value of bringing together people with differing perspectives<br />&#8211; Most importantly, joining Farset Labs taught me the value of community</p>



<p>Over the years of I have been delighted by the impact of these actions and privileged to have responsibility over them.</p>



<p>As a director, my goal would be simple &#8211; keep alive the light of our energetic environment and preserve the welcoming community I encountered three years ago. The areas I will invest most of my time in are:</p>



<p>&#8211; introducing a wider community of active individuals to our hackerspace<br />&#8211; providing opportunities to up and coming members of our community<br />&#8211; ensuring that the space remains genuinely useful to our evolving community<br />&#8211; lighten the burden of maintenance to allow more room for efforts in growth<br />&#8211; keep our management practices in touch with the community’s sentiments and beliefs<br /><br />Our local community is bustling with life and activity &#8211; let&#8217;s show them what a hackerspace can be.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Andy Sheppard</h3>



<p>Hello there! My name is Andy. I&#8217;m one of the founding members of Farset Labs, and I&#8217;m finally here to pitch in my nomination for directorship. My main reason is that I love Farset, and really want to see it grow. I have experience in leadership, and management and all those other boring things, but I also just really love to help people.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever spoken to me, you probably already know that, but maybe not! I do tend to ramble. In fact I&#8217;m rambling right now.</p>



<p>As I said, I just want to see the place grow, and thrive, and I feel that I&#8217;d be a good person to see that happen. Once I have something planned, I do my damned best to make sure that happens!</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t spoken to me before, I&#8217;d encourage you to do so! I love to hear stories of people&#8217;s experiences, and I also just really love to talk to people. But sure, let me know!</p>



<p>Much love, and all the best, </p>



<p>Andy S</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">RON</h3>



<p>Vote to reopen nominations if you are unsatisfied with the candidates offered and wish to have the nomination period reopened to new candidates. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three Directors back in late 2011/early 2012. We aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, and given that we&#8217;re currently below that magic prime number, it&#8217;s time to launch our 2018 Director Elections. Nominations for Directorship will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday 28th September</strong>.</span></p>
<p>The Directors of Farset Labs are the individuals expected to set the strategic direction of the charity, and have overall responsibility for maintaining the financial and legal health of the company. You will be expected to join the weekly management meetings and contribute in myriad other ways to the day-to-day running of the space; for example, fielding emails, authorising outgoing payments, and meeting with relevant parties, to name but a few.</p>
<p>You also get to steward a charity that does extensive youth outreach, makes opportunities available for the whole community, and hosts events that benefit all areas of the technology sector. We&#8217;re always trying to expand the remit of our offerings to serve even more people and it would be ideal for the incoming Director to aid in those efforts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nominate themselves.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their name.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December is nearly upon us and with it comes a raft of Farset events! What better way to christen our <strong>new and improved Event Space</strong>?</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Kicking off the month, we have our regular casual talk series, <strong>Explain it Like I&#8217;m 5</strong>, where some great speakers break down a concept they have experience with and present it in seven minutes. We&#8217;ve had everything from baking to plasma physics in the past and we welcome talks from the floor on the night.</p>
<p>Join us on <strong>Thursday 1st December at 1800</strong> for some truly entertaining talks, plus a Japanese buffet and plenty of time to chat with other attendees. Read more <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/eli5_dec16/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Next up, we have the annual <strong>Farset Christmas Party</strong> in the form of a pot-luck dinner. Culinary hacks are encouraged and the event is <strong>open to all</strong>. Bring something edible and bring a friend, but please don&#8217;t bring an edible friend &#8211; that&#8217;d be against the law and not much fun for the friend. <strong>Party poppers, retro console gaming and festive treats await!</strong></p>
<p>The Christmas party kicks off at <strong>1900 on Friday 2nd December</strong> and you can get more details <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-seasonal-pot-luck-dinner-hack-2016/">here</a>.  Do let us know you&#8217;re coming via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/584209385112871/">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Finally, the management team have been toiling hard (as always!) to improve the Labs and, having been working extensively on sprucing up the Event Space, we&#8217;re now turning our attention to the Workshop. As discussed on <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Slack</a>, the <strong>Workshop Clearout</strong> will be taking place this weekend (<strong>Saturday 3rd and Sunday 4th December</strong>). Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Member equipment that is in member project boxes will, of course, remain untouched, as will any clearly labelled equipment as per the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">member handbook</a>. If you have left any kit in a position that may have, shall we say, not quite complied with the rules, please give us a shout on <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to make sure we know about it and that it&#8217;s not disposed of. Any queries, as always, can also be directed to that address.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be relocating a few pieces of equipment to more suitable homes within the workshop and this should make using the space a lot easier for all. Naturally, this means that the workshop can&#8217;t be used for any member projects during the clear-out and we apologise for the disruption.</p>
<p>If you want to see what&#8217;s planned (particularly disposal of equipment believed to be communal and unwanted), check out the barebones plan available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h3twkWYZtflMa_pxFwoiaan-P59qOIg9Ut5HdLnO7rY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You learn something new everyday, usually without trying. Maybe you find a shortcut to a friend&#8217;s house, maybe a trick on the computer or maybe you realise that Thermos of tea in the car was a <em>really</em> bad idea. But what if you could get an overview of weird and wonderful topics from folks who know the ins and outs of them really well?</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain Like I’m 5&#8221; is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>This event is sponsored by the very lovely folks from <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10456">BCS Belfast Branch</a>!</strong></p>
<h4><strong>The Audience:</strong></h4>
<p>The target audience is <strong>anyone and everyone who loves learning</strong> and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by an <strong>intermission with drinks and a selection of Japanese food</strong> (just to shake things up!). There will be ample time to have a chat with all the other good folks who come down.</p>
<h4><strong>The Rules:</strong></h4>
<p>The rules for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations. <strong>The blackboard is your friend.</strong></li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share to the audience, email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”. Submissions are also more than welcome on the night!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch:</p>
<p><strong>1. Colin Mitchell</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2804 " src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cm-portrait-1-276x300.jpg" width="191" height="208" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cm-portrait-1-276x300.jpg 276w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cm-portrait-1.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" /></p>
<p>My involvement with Farset Labs started when it was a dark glint in Bolster&#8217;s evil eye. I say &#8216;involvement&#8217; &#8211; it was really just supportive conversations, but once established this quickly turned into an obligation to join, and a membership fee has been ripped bodily from my strained bank account ever since.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not all bad&#8230;</p>
<p>Some of the things I love about Farset Labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slight tendency towards anarchy</li>
<li>The attempts at real democracy</li>
<li>The diversity of people + their abilities</li>
<li>The sense of community and random connections</li>
<li>The stuff all over the place</li>
<li>All the code &#8216;n shit with the young people ‘n all</li>
</ul>
<p>I love the sense of &#8216;if it ain&#8217;t broke, break it&#8217; &#8211; (though not Robin Prices&#8217;s lighting-up ping-pong table, nor Matt Hazley&#8217;s beer-making kit, &#8216;cos the phrase &#8216;don&#8217;t break stuff that makes beer&#8217; should need no explanation)</p>
<p>Currently I&#8217;m CTO/co-founder of Sixty-5 Technologies &#8211; Farset&#8217;s co-working space was where we spent a lot of last year. Bolster was instrumental in John Arrell &amp; I getting together, David Kane helped with initial specs, Robin Price worked on our Gateway box, Mal Duffin seriously improved our UI, Art Knipe straightened up our API &#8211; all invaluable &amp; there&#8217;s nowhere else in NI where that could happen.</p>
<p>As well as techie stuff I&#8217;ve done sales &amp; marketing, management &amp; director stuff &#8211; so I can bring wide experience with an anarchic twist.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m doing a lot of coding (at 57, I know, God help us) &#8211; most of the Sixty-5 Android code &amp; some of the Ruby on Rails cloud stuff is mine. Also devops stuff with servers and all that kind of thing. I love all the hands-on stuff.</p>
<p>So, for Farset, as well as sharing the organisational burden with the others, there are a bunch of things that interest me:</p>
<p>Connectivity between the diverse membership and the wider community &#8211; both social and industrial. There&#8217;s all sorts of interesting stuff that Farset members could be part of, if it interests them. Let&#8217;s find more of these things.</p>
<p>Learning &#8211; there are so many different ways to get engaged in tech &amp; to learn without going through the established education routes (with their gatekeepers). Some of that Farset is already doing well. I love the idea of someone coming through Farset from no tech knowledge to paid work. Or just for fun.</p>
<p>Farset has a lot of potential to act as an incubator for early stage startups &#8211; there&#8217;s already a bunch of that happening right now (Sixty-5 is but one example)</p>
<p>Diversity &#8211; I love diversity &amp; inclusion. We can extend what we already have.</p>
<p>I love people poking at projects &#8211; how can we do more of this?</p>
<p>I love the idea that in years to come, world-changing stuff or people might have had their roots in Farset. That would be something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><strong>Update:</strong> Due to several factors outside of our control, the directors have decided to postpone this series of elections until later in the year. Thanks!</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Ben Bland for warmer shores (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua">quite literally</a>), it&#8217;s time to launch our 2015 Director Elections. Nominations will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 18th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Nominees must:</p>

<ul style="color: #222222;">
<li>Nominate themselves.</li>
<li>Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</li>
<li>Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with
<ul>
<li>Their name.</li>
<li>Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</li>
<li>Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #222222;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Thursday 19th February</strong> and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 27th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch:</p>
<p><strong>1. Conor Robinson</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/users/conor/activity"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1823" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/24286_759331984096373_142323857_n-300x3001.jpg" alt="24286_759331984096373_142323857_n" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Well here we are, two and a half years on. In the years since formation, Farset has grown.</p>
<p>We have grown in numbers, in experience, and in maturity.</p>
<p>I’ve been a paying member of Farset since day one, and was a member of QUESTS (The Queen’s Society that worked together to set Farset up) even before that. You can see me in the old photos from the days of our scouting out buildings to rent!</p>
<p>Alongside Farset and QUESTS, I founded the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QUBARES">QUB Amateur Radio &amp; Electronics Society</a>, through which I teach amateur radio courses with the Radio Society of Great Britain.</p>
<p>Having just completed an industrial placement year with <a href="http://www.andor.com/">Andor Technology</a>, I’ve gained invaluable real-life experience in industry.</p>
<p>I feel that the director’s role in Farset is to facilitate the members’ needs. To provide the resources required for members to achieve what they want to achieve.</p>
<p>As such, I intend to keep Farset involved in education schemes and programmes, so that we can have a tangible and measurable impact on our membership and our community. I would like to see Farset expand in the area of electronic hardware design, and would intend to promote that area to the director group, and to the membership at large.</p>
<p>Let’s keep growing.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Conor is an active contributor to the IRL Farset Community, as well as the <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/director-elections-2014/543/4">Discourse</a>, where you can ask him any questions either privately via his <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/users/conor/activity">profile</a> or in the open by summoning him from the ether with &#8220;@Conor&#8221;.</p>
