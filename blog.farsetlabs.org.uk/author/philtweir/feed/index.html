										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An Open Day</em> <strong>12pm &#8211; 6pm</strong> &amp; <em>A Free Evening </em><strong>6pm &#8211; 9pm</strong></p>
<p>Join us at Farset Labs for the inaugural Columba’s Day &#8211; a day of creativity, collaboration, and sharing of art and culture all under the umbrella of open licences from copyright free to Creative Commons (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a>).</p>
<p>There will be a wide variety of activities on offer on the day from family friendly workshops, performances, exhibitions, etc.  We can exclusively reveal we have Andy Luke, Photography from David Kane, Tote Bag Print Workshop, Folkadelic, and Belfast Improv Theatre with more to come!</p>
<p>Intrigued and want to find out more?  We have a handy FAQ here:-</p>
<p><a href="https://columba.st/faq/">https://columba.st/faq/</a></p>
<p>The mood will be relaxed with focus on collaboration and creativity &#8211; don’t let that put you off, there are many ways of getting involved and enjoying the day even if you do not feel you’re ‘creative’.  As befits the ethos of the day, food will be available by way of a potluck and we would welcome your culinary creations.</p>
<p>After the main event, we will finish off with an informal evening (6pm &#8211; 9pm) including a screening of a suitable copyright free film.</p>
<p>And what’s better than a day of open licence arts and culture?  The fact that it’s <b>FREE</b>!  We would be grateful though if a donation of £5 can be considered to go to Farset Labs &#8211; our wonderful hosts who rely on membership fees and charitable donations to keep their lights on.  Tickets can be booked here:</p>

<p>We will also have images (shared under the relevant Creative Commons licence) projected onto the big screen in the event space, and some prints wall-mounted for the day as well.  If yours is printed you are welcome to collect and take it home on the day. If you wish you can donate your image to be used for the enhancement of Farset’s co-working space. Submissions can be made via Dropbox:</p>

<p>Deadline for submissions for anything to be printed will be 11.59pm Sunday, 3rd June.  If you wish to specify what can be printed please identify this within the text file.</p>
