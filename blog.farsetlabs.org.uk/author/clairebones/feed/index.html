										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">After a very successful event last year, Farset Labs has decided to take part for a second year in <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam will run from Friday 24th to Sunday 26th January, and is a chance to meet some great people and develop a fun game with a theme. The theme will be announced on the night, and there will be plenty of people there to team up with to create something interesting and, most importantly, to have fun!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Global Game Jam is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts,from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games For Change</a> movement.  There are already a number of <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors">sponsors</a> involved in this year’s global event, including PlayStation Mobile, Unity and Github.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009, and this year there are already over 350 individual Jam sites registered around the world. We will be live streaming video from sites all over during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see (and perhaps play) other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue, for anyone not familiar, can be found on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/jam-sites/farset-labs">listing</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry, we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! For anyone interested, this year you can list your skills ahead of the event <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhNxF3GWLga_dHJXLW43S1QwcDdYa1phWi1JVjFjUEE&amp;usp=sharing">here</a> and see what other skills and abilities participants will have. The organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams, and we have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entry to the event is free, though it is asked that you register on the Global Game Jam site if you are participating. We also have an Eventbrite listing for the event to allow people to register and give us an idea of numbers. The theme will be announced at 5pm on the Friday so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time. Looking forward to seeing you all for this, it should be a great weekend!</p>

<p dir="ltr">PS We are looking for corporate sponsorship for this event to cover venue and refreshments costs, but the event will go on regardless. If you&#8217;d be interested in helping us out, <a href="mailto:ggj@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!</p>

It’s a great chance to pass on those things you can’t bring yourself to get rid of, or to grab something exciting for a bit of a bargain.</p>
<p>It’s also an opportunity for any creative types who’d like to grab a spot to showcase their talents to a different audience &#8211; baking, art, whatever you can create you can sell (though let’s try to keep it legal!)</p>
<p>Members and non-members will be buying and selling things in the event space all morning. Table spots are free for members or non-members, so if you’d like a spot to sell your things sign yourself up on the <a title="Eventbrite page" href="http://fsl-bnb-es2005.eventbrite.com/?rank=1">Eventbrite page</a>. Entry to the event will be free, though donations are always welcome of course, so just turn up between 10:00 &#8211; 13:00 and see how many things you can buy and manage to transport home.</p>
