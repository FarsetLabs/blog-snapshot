										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The entire Farset Labs membership were invited to the Town Hall meeting on Saturday the 16th of February, 2013, and a total of 7 active members turned up, with some additional people turning up out of interest. Among the matters of business was one vote and a discussion on all other issues, as detailed below.</p>
<h3>Code of Conduct Review</h3>
<p>As mandated in the Code of Conduct, the document is to be reviewed at least once a year, but may be changed at any time given the approval of the membership. The review for 2013 was held at the February Town Hall meeting, and it passed with a vote of 7 ayes, 0 noes and 0 abstentions. The changes outlined were mostly wording changes, but some new clauses covering the use of specialised equipment, the use of VPS, VPN and Web services provided by Evorack and Tibus, and a clause governing member representation of Farset Labs (to protect the members from any legal liability).</p>
<p>These changes will be made available soon and the online versions of the Code will be updated appropriately. If you have any issues or wish to change or add anything in the Code, please bring it up at the next Town Hall meeting, or get in touch as outlined below.</p>
<h3>Other Matters of Business</h3>
<p>In other news, investigations are ongoing to price reversible (fleece/waterproof jacket) coats branded with the Labs&#8217; logo and member names/handles, plus some other apparel options. A &#8220;common sense&#8221; ideology for use of the 3D printer and other specialised, easy-to-wreck equipment was stressed, and a tally of the workshop tools to date, both installed and incoming, was taken.</p>
<p>The store&#8217;s indexing system to make things easily to find and return is complete, with the allocations changing as the best practice becomes apparent. In the next while, truly useless items will be disposed of. They will be left for a period of 1 week and will be advertised on our social media outlets if you are interested in taking them yourself.</p>
<p>After our first birthday (more on that soon), two new Director positions will be open to voting for the membership body, with any member not disqualified from holding a directorship to a UK Limited Company being eligible. After the first elections, there will be subsequent elections every year for all five positions.</p>
<p>The state of the Labs&#8217; finances was reviewed, with an overall positive result. However, as our utilities and equipment use grows, we will need more income, and <strong>could do with some more members</strong>.</p>
<p>The series of events scheduled for the upcoming month was laid out, with comments made on future Gathering of Lightening talks regarding presenting. Our GoL talks are open to members and the general public; admission is ticket-based because it is usually a very popular event.</p>
<p>Open discussion to the floor quickly turned jokey, but one non-member who attended commented that we should consider buying lots of canned air.</p>
<h3> The next meeting</h3>
<p>The next Town Hall meeting will be scheduled for March 2013 and will be published widely with good notice. Comments, complaints and questions can be sent via email (<a href="http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/" target="_blank">anonymously</a> or not), but voting matters are open to members only who attend the meeting.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our long and exciting <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume campaign</a> is finally over, and there is evidently plenty of support for a 3D printer within the space &#8211; we raised over £100 extra by the time the fundraiser was finished. In the time that it ran, we saw very evident spikes and patterns, which coincided nicely with various announcements and media publishers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg1.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-853" title="oimg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg-300x1851.png" alt="Breakdown of rewards" width="300" height="185" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-853" class="wp-caption-text">Breakdown of donators by which reward they chose</figcaption></figure>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who helped get the word out about the campaign, and would especially like to thank every single person who backed the Sponsume appeal. Even now we are getting occasional offers from people who want to chip in a little more towards consumables. We hope that everyone that donated enjoys their rewards, which will be sent out in the following weeks after they are all organised and produced.</p>
<p>Once the custom print rewards are finished, the 3D printer will be open for every member of Farset Labs to access whenever they wish. Significant quantities of PLA and ABS plastic have been ordered, and this is open for all members to use in small-scale production. Anyone wishing to make lots of models or make very big items is requested to play fair and <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">buy their own plastic</a>, or donate towards getting more for the space. Apart from that, there are absolutely no restrictions on use, and we look forward to seeing what people make with the machine.</p>
<p>The Ultimaker is <strong>now in the post</strong>, and is expected within around a week. Announcements will be made when it arrives, and everyone involved in the fundraiser and purchase will be invited down to build and be the first to use it.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone that helped. Thanks to you, we now have a fantastic tool to make Farset Labs a much more useful and interesting place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">UPDATED</span>:&nbsp;</strong></em><em>The original letters sent to Farset Labs have been linked to throughout the article for context and transparency. Further questions will be answered via email at admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs has gone from strength to strength since opening its doors in April of this year, and the community has grown and matured quickly, but our summer progress was slower than was hoped for. Our entire model and ethos is built on transparency and democracy, so we publish this document to explain to our membership and supporters the difficulties placed in our path due to litigation launched by Latens/Pace plc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of the blue, on the 14th June, multiple copies of <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Letter-to-Farset-Labs-14th-June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> were hand delivered to Farset Labs by Pinsent Masons, legal representatives of Latens/Pace, as well as emailed to several different accounts of the Directors whether they were Farset Labs related or personal, work and university inboxes. One of our members had been accused on their last day of work of stealing sensitive Confidential Information from their employer and transmitting it to Farset Labs. The letter explained that we had possession of their property, and that it it was on our equipment. It demanded that we exclude an allegedly-involved member from the premises and cut all communication with him pending completion of their investigations. Two of the Directors have known the member for almost a decade, having gone to the same school, and so for a demand to come through to sever all contact was seen to be unreasonable.<span id="more-731"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the demands of the letter were not finished, but became unfeasible. We were required to provide ‘confirmation by return’ that third party computer specialists hired by Latens/Pace would be allowed unfettered access to the premises and all equipment to forensically image the equipment and ‘assess any other use of such equipment in relation to the Confidential Information’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final demand was for us to undertake that, by 4pm the next day, any Confidential Information in our control would not be used or shared, but returned to Latens or destroyed at their option. We were happy to comply with this one, since we were safe in the knowledge that we didn’t have any of these supposed trade secrets.&nbsp;The letter then finished by informing the Directors of their possibly criminal liability in failing to return the stolen information and in handling stolen goods.. This was a difficulty, given that we had no stolen information to return. However, curiously for a supposed crime of this magnitude, Latens had elected not to involve the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our reply addressed all the points, but we paid particular attention to the third demand (forensically imaging all equipment), pointing out that, if we assisted Latens in imaging members’ personal laptops and other devices on the premises, we really would be handling stolen goods this time around, as well as committing several acts under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We were very firm in disagreeing with Latens/Pace on this point. We also elected to continue our usual contact with the member, given that we had seen no evidence so far of any theft of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the Directors had <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Eoghan-Murray-Latens-14.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters</a> delivered to their places of work reminding us of our ‘liability as an officer of the company for offences by the company under the Fraud Act 2006’ and to be ‘aware that there are sanctions in place under the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 with regard to the making of false statements with intent to deceive by company directors’.&nbsp;Not only is it, in our opinion, a defamation of character to be served by a legal aide in front of colleagues, we feel that this action was bordering on harassment and caused distress to us, given we were being threatened with the possibility of criminal prosecution in relation to an event that we had been first made aware of when a flurry of identical emails had landed in every inbox we had, whether or not the inbox was related to Farset Labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We felt we had no option but to seek legal advice and responded via our solicitors from this point onwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pinsent Masons then sent through a <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Farset_Labs_-undertakings_19_6_12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list of undertakings</a> required by them. All through this, immense pressure was put on the Directors to sign various documents within hours, with no real time to consult counsel or other authorities. We did not bow to these pressures, but it began to affect our running of Farset Labs and our everyday work and academic activities.&nbsp;Among these undertakings, key points included: provision of the network architecture within Farset and storage of electronic information; security arrangements within Farset Labs; and a provision of a log of the time, size and description of any electronic information flow from Latens to Farset.&nbsp;We then spent valuable time and effort trying to make Pinsent Masons understand that our front-end router does not log that information, so it was simply impossible for us to provide it, but the replies generally just quoted the same demands again and again.&nbsp;Several emails went back and forth, eating up time and money, before we finally got <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Revised-Undertakings-27.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of the undertakings</a> provided to us that would be possible for us to sign. We signed this and returned it, hoping that it would bring the situation to a conclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sadly, if anything, it got even more disjointed and difficult. Despite our repeated offers of a face-to-face meeting with Latens to help try and resolve the situation, the responses from Pinsent Masons ignored these, never mentioning them. The demands became more warped, sometimes making little sense. One of our personal favourites was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong><em>Answer 1.3(a) – Please confirm if the metal project boxes are lockable whilst also on&nbsp;the network when in the boxes.</em></strong></p>
<p>We assure you that this has <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Adam-Curry-Mills-Selig-enc-revised-undertakings-16.07.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not been taken out of context</a> in any way. None of the Directors of Farset nor our legal team could make sense of this and, at this stage, with the blessing of our solicitor, we informed Pinsent Masons that we would not be communicating further, as the requests had become repetitive, spurious and, we suspected, simply an attempt to harass us. We were also advised that, had Latens truly thought a breach had taken place, they would have collected evidence and brought all parties involved to court long before now or, at the very least, involved the PSNI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We then learned that the Latens personnel handling the Pinsent Masons team had gone on holiday towards the end of this, such was the severity, urgency and threat of this terrible crisis. This also explained why the technical acumen in the responses to our explanations was lacking. The net result of this experience was that we had lost time and sleep over a non-issue, mainly due to the extremely poor handling of the matter by Latens/Pace and their lawyers at Pinsent Masons. We have also been left with a gaping four-figure hole in our already-limited budget from legal expenses, which has threatened the very existence of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>After several months of silence from Pinsent Masons, we sent a letter via recorded delivery to the CEO of Pace detailing these events and the insanity of the entire episode, inviting comment and possibly aid, but have had no response, despite a follow-up phone call and ample time.<br />
In conclusion, the company and its Directors have been dragged through hell for no reason in a case that Latens/Pace now appear to have lost interest in, despite their initial misdirected fury. Farset Labs has been dealt a severe and nearly fatal financial blow, stunting its growth and preventing new equipment and services being offered to our members. In short, Latens/Pace have struck out needlessly at the voluntary technical community in Belfast and have sadly, though given the chance, made no effort to repair the consequences of, or even explain, their actions.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.34153042919933796"></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Anyone wishing to get further explanation of events, or to get in touch with the Directors of Farset Labs about this matter or otherwise should contact admin@farsetlabs.org.uk.</em></p>

Bobbie flew over from Brighton specifically for the two-hour event, and landed mid-morning in the George Best Belfast City Airport. After some breakfast, he and those at Farset settled into setting up for the event.</p>
<p>The talk kicked off at 4pm with an interested crowd engaging in the two-hour-long interactive talk, with many asking questions, particularly on Bobbie&#8217;s challenges he had faced. Specifically, Mr Johnson spoke about his Kickstarter success with Matter and the process that shaped it, particularly the viral nature of the fundraising campaign. He spoke of how the majority of the money was raised in under 36 hours, leaving much more time to work on the final product.</p>
<p>Matter is a soon-to-be-released online publication for long-form journalism and in-depth reporting. Hopefully pumping four stories out per month eventually, it aims to replicate the investigative meat of a print magazine but with a more granular purchasing mechanism allowing readers to buy what they want to read and no more; signal-to-noise improvement, as it were. It is set to launch soon with one long story, with more being added regularly to produce a regular stream of content.</p>
<p>The talk continued with more questions probing the need for such a service, to which Bobbie answered that he and his team had decided to do it just because no-one else had, and to test the model. Questions continued for around an hour afterwards and the group broke up shortly afterwards, after several one-on-one discussions and some networking.</p>
<p>Bobbie will be <a href="http://blog.readmatter.com/post/34105823590/appearances">talking at several venues</a> in the near future about Matter to promote its upcoming launch, and the <a href="http://hackshackersbelfast.tumblr.com/">Belfast chapter of HacksHackers</a> will likely be returning in the near future to Farset for more events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs is adopting a new membership model in the next few weeks to adapt to the different needs of the different types of members in the space. This both helps students and those of low income by significantly cutting the costs of membership, and provides a bed for more wealthy people to get access to more expensive features at a very low price compared to for-profit ventures.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The Current Model</h1>
<p>As all members will be aware, the current model of membership operates at a fixed amount payable each month, with a £5 discount for people with valid student cards at recognised academic institutions. At this time, the membership fee is £30 per month, making it £25 per month for students.</p>
<h1>Reasons for the change</h1>
<p>A lot of people have approached Farset Labs with the intention of joining, only to be discouraged from signing up due to the relatively high costs involved. This is most noticeable in students and those with lower incomes. These are precisely the kind of people Farset Labs needs to be vibrant, so we need to tailor to them first. Similarly, more professional members have expressed a wish for more business-like features and high-end features, which will be made available at a premium.</p>
<p>These changes were discussed at the<a title="Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/"> Town Hall</a> meeting this month and the community who attended accepted the plan.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>Some of the listed advantages (specifically the job board and Asterisk-based phone systems) are not available yet, but we&#8217;re pushing these administrative changes for new members out as quickly as possible to give Freshers coming to the Belfast area to study, and recent grads coming to work here, an even greater incentive to join the community.</p>
<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>The membership model will now be modelled with four distinct levels, each with different levels of access and varying features, and a proportionate price to match. These roles will cover from basic student membership up to “honorary” membership for those who wish to financially support Farset Labs or with to provide extra monetary help on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Our <a title="Membership" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Membership</a> page has been updated to reflect a summary of these roles</p>
<h2>Student Membership</h2>
<p>Student membership for Farset Labs will be priced at £15 per month and is available to all members with a valid student card at a recognised academic institution, and those attending a recognised school.</p>
<p>This level of membership offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the space while it is open, but not 24-hour access#;</li>

<p>This discount will apply for <em>as long as they maintain their current membership</em>; changing down to a lower level and switching back to Freelancer membership will incur a £35 per month membership cost as usual.</p>
<h1>Concessions for Starving Hackers</h1>
<p>At Farset Labs’ discretion, non-students may be offered a student rate, with the same access rights as Student membership, <em>minus voting rights</em>. This will be offered to those known to be in genuine need only and will not be overtly advertised. (Other than this blog post I guess&#8230;)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our members and followers, will be aware, Flacknite is our semi-regular monthly hackathon, spanning at least 24 hours, which is open to everyone. It provides a bed, a home and an excuse for projects that have been put back, and a lively environment for more time-sensitive ones. As always, they&#8217;re catered with food and drink, which this month was generously sponsored by <a title="Instil" href="http://instil.co/">Instil Software</a>.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s Flacknite ran on September 15th and 16th, and brought to life several different projects. Several internal software projects marched onwards towards completion, piecing together our in-house management system and building control network.</p>
<figure id="attachment_664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-664" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.131.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-664" title="2012-09-16 04.35.13" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.13-300x1791.jpg" alt="Culture Night Preparations" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-664" class="wp-caption-text">Electronics and LED-testing going on into the night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more exciting and eye-catching work took the form of some preparations for <a href="http://www.culturenightbelfast.com/">Culture Night</a>, which has been making news throughout Belfast and scheduled for tonight, Friday 21st September. Robin, an artist attending Culture Night, built and tested several high-power LED array bars, to be used in his project to under-illuminate a table. His work will be on show tonight near the Hayfield Market in Belfast City Centre.</p>
<p>A welcome break came in the form of <a href="http://operapizza.co.uk/">Opera Pizza</a>, which delivered a substantial order to our door for all to graze on. Beer and pizza flowed plentifully for several hours after the delivery.</p>
<figure id="attachment_666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-666" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.371.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-666 " title="2012-09-16 01.47.37" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.37-300x1791.jpg" alt="The BBC Micro lives!" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-666" class="wp-caption-text">The BBC Micro lives!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Work continued in other parts of the building, with Dan Reid and Tom Gilmour working with others to bring to life two BBC Micro computers, both of which had dead power supplies. They were successful and much of the remainder of the night was spent programming the Micros, and upgrading their RAM installations. Dan continued in the following days to install more RAM and software, and the two computers are approaching &#8220;perfect working order&#8221; condition.</p>
<p>Others worked on personal projects and private endeavours, and most stuck around until the daylight hours on Sunday. Numbers waned due to sleep, but recovered later on Sunday. Overall, numbers were good and the atmosphere was great. Our next Flacknite will be next month, on the 20th October, and will be publicised heavily to let everyone know.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.instil.co">Instil Software</a> for their generosity, and for everyone that came along to such a good night!</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>

For a while, we&#8217;ve been playing with the idea of getting rid of the suspended fibre ceiling in the space and exposing the period pillars and beams, and after a day&#8217;s experimentation, it&#8217;s decided: we&#8217;re going ahead!</p>
<p>What the vision entails is exposing the entirety of the building&#8217;s original woodwork and support pillars, and restoring them to their former glory. New architectural lighting, black ceiling beams and renovated cable management are all in the master plan, as well as some lovely aesthetic improvements like stripping the cast iron pillars to the bare metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-538" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px 6px;" title="2012-06-12 13.28.03" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.03-150x1501.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>However, we&#8217;ll need some assistance.</strong></p>
<p>We currently do not have many sets of <strong>ladders</strong> which are a crucial part of the project. Limited timescale and funds mean that the ceiling needs to be finished very promptly, so all help possible is appreciated.</p>
<p>We would greatly appreciate anyone who would be willing to help out or<strong> lend us some stepladders</strong> for the duration of the project; without your help it will be much harder to restore the Old Schoolhouse to its former glory!</p>
<p>If you would like to <strong>help out in any way</strong>, or would be willing to lend us some equipment, materials, or their time, please get in contact through the usual channels.</p>

<p>After the final touches to our massive blackboard were completed in the event space, and after</p>
<p>the initial rush of impulse drawing had subsided, two members jointly decided to have a go at something more interesting. Myself and <a title="Dan's Twitter feed" href="https://twitter.com/#!/stealthii">Daniel Reid</a> used a <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/InFocus-LP120.htm">kindly-donated projector</a> and a packet of white chalk, coupled with a helping of patience to fashion a door-sized QR code right in the middle of the giant blackboard.</p>
<p>Initially, it didn&#8217;t work, with the contrast between the thin chalk and deep black surround too low to help our <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php">phone</a> camera do its part at decoding. A quick glance at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Design">QR specifications</a> made the modifications easy to conduct; as soon as the lock-on points in the corners were detected by the phone, the code scanned perfectly.</p>
<p>It showed two previously-clueless people the inner workings of the codes, and some plans have been formed for some artistic decals for the event space walls along the lines of the QR codes. The rest of the blackboard is still occupied by the ever-growing mass of <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-18-14.45.351.jpg">colourful scribbles</a>.</p>

The plumbers have completely fitted the toilets to a great standard and the electricians are making sense of the circuits around the building; the puzzle pieces that were outside our control have pretty much fallen into place. After a long day driving to collect tables, hoovering endless dust and generally cleaning up, we&#8217;re about to pack up for the night, exhausted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve fitted out the reception area with a little more server equipment and a slightly fancier network configuration, and have the water supply turned on, making the space a lot more pleasant to be in. The contractors are finishing up and our outer window frames received a welcome coat of paint. Windows were scraped and the equipment store was further populated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, final preparations include the plumbers and electricians finishing up, the hopeful delivery of our electric cooker, preparations for the rooms and general last-minute cleaning.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see you all at our <a title="Launch Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191615090954138/">launch event</a> tomorrow at 3pm!</p>
