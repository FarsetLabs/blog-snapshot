										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h1>



<ul><li>In light of current HMG and NI Executive Guidance, and in accordance to our communicated <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/coronavirus">staging plans</a>, we’ve decided to begin a phased return to Unit 1, starting <strong>Wednesday the 24nd of June at 10am</strong>,&nbsp;</li><li>There will be new extraordinary guidelines in place regarding conduct within the space, enforcing social distancing, and relevant PPE and hygiene recommendations.</li><li><strong>Access will be ‘opt-in’</strong> so if you wish to return to the space, email <a href="mailto:art@farsetlabs.org.uk" data-type="mailto" data-id="mailto:art@farsetlabs.org.uk">art@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> and we’ll arrange for you to digitally sign the pre-return disclaimer and issue you with new access control codes.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other News While We’ve Been in Lockdown</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/FarsetLabs/status/1246124950282481666">We have lent our new Lulzbot Mini 3D printer to Axial3D</a> for their PPE manufacturing project, providing first responders and medical staff with near-medical-grade safety equipment to combat Coronavirus.</li><li>Our <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/241330">Folding@Home team</a> burned a lot of CPU-cycles to contribute to COVID19 Research, currently ranked in the top 2% of teams in the world.</li><li>New <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/288">CCTV policy</a> in place along with ICO registration that clarifies that CCTV is only to be used for security and compliance with law enforcement and no other purpose (along with a 30 day retention period)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/FarsetLabs/status/1273636588074000385">#BreakfastClub</a> has been operating 6 days a week since March, with members meeting up via Discord to catch up about their days and share.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23infosecni&amp;src=typed_query">#InfoSecNI</a>, a professional practice network of cybersecurity workers, has been running semi-regular movie nights and tweet-alongs, with Hackers, Sneakers, and WarGames all being shown (And critiqued!). We’ve been supporting #InfoSecNI with communications and technical resources.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Guidelines</h1>



<p><em>Published both here and at </em><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy"><em>https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy</em></a><em> for completeness</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purpose</h2>



<p>The purpose of these guidelines is to set out the procedures and restrictions that are put in place to allow Farset Labs to open in a safe manner during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</p>



<p>These temporary guidelines will remain under constant review, with particular respect to any changes in government guidelines or restrictions. Should any subsequent government policy contradict any aspect of these guidelines it will be expected that Farset Labs and it’s members will immediately comply with government policy.</p>



<p>In issuing these guidelines the Labs trustees acknowledge that it may be necessary to close the building again at short notice in response to future government directives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organisational Named Person For COVID-19 Response</h2>



<p>Best practices dictate that organisations should have a named person responsible for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>As such, Art Knipe will be responsible for these guidelines, will be the contact person for questions regarding our response to COVID-19 and will be responsible for organisational contact tracing in the event of a member reporting an infection. (art@farsetlabs.org.uk).</p>



<p>Should Art be unable to fulfil this role for any reason Colin Mitchell will deputise (colin.mitchell@farsetlabs.org.uk)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Guidelines for Reopening of Farset Labs</h2>



<p>Farset Labs will begin a phased reopening on 24/06/20 at 10am. The reopening will proceed based on the following guidance:</p>



<ul><li>Upon reopening we will request that our members continue to work from home if they can, in line with the<a href="https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf"> guidance from the NI Executive</a>.</li><li>Access to the building will be subject to these new guidelines.</li><li>It will be left to the discretion and good sense of individual members to decide whether they can continue to work from home or need to use the space.</li><li>All members will be required to complete and sign an online Pre-Return form which indicates their agreement with these guidelines. This must be done before they can return to the space.</li></ul>



<p>If you wish to return to the space at this time, you must contact Art Knipe by email (art@farsetlabs.org.uk) to notify him of your intention to return. You will then be asked to fill in a Pre-Return Disclaimer, after which you will be given new access control codes.</p>



<p><strong>Do not return to the space if you have not already digitally signed the pre-return disclaimer as you will not be permitted in the building</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Guidelines For Access To Farset Labs During Ongoing COVID-19 Restrictions</h2>



<p>It is anticipated that social distancing restrictions will remain in place for some time. In order to respect these restrictions and to ensure the levels of cleanliness required to prevent infection members will be expected to adhere to the following guidelines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to the #COVID19 pandemic, Farset Labs has made the following decisions.</p>



<ol><li>We are <strong>no longer hosting any public events</strong> as part of Farset Labs programmes (CoderDojo, ELi5, DataArt, etc)</li><li>All Meetings (Town Hall, Management, Trustees) will be <strong>remote</strong>.</li><li>It is recommended that external/community hires of the space also suspend, but events will over all be restricted to <strong>less than 15</strong> participants.</li><li>It is recommended that <strong>no more than 15 people</strong> are in the building at any one time</li><li>The facility will <strong>continue to be open</strong> to those who wish to use it, following reasonable precautions outlined below.</li><li>Private Meetings can still take place on site if <strong>reasonable precautions</strong> are enforced.</li><li><strong>Do not visit if you are symptomatic</strong> (continuous cough or high temperature).</li><li>If you develop symptoms and have visited the space in the previous 10 days, <strong>please notify us</strong> on <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></li><li><strong>Hand Sanitiser and Soap</strong> will become available throughout the building. </li><li>Facilities are being made available for event organisers to <strong>stream presentations </strong>to support sustaining their own communities online free of charge.</li></ol>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Provision of Streaming Facilities for Event Operators</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last week, we set up a<a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/event-space-streaming-av-setup/26"> two-camera streaming capability</a> in the event space. This capability is being made available to all event organisers; members or otherwise, for the purposes of hosting online events with presenters. We’re currently awaiting delivery of an HDMI capture device to include higher resolution of projected screen contents, but if you’d like to take advantage of this facility, please get in touch on <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Reasonable Precautions&nbsp;</h1>



<p>(As per <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS </a>and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">WHO</a> Advice)</p>



<ul><li>Wash hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds with hot water and soap.</li><li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.</li><li>Stay at home if you’ve got coronavirus symptoms.<ul><li>New, continuous cough.</li><li>High temperature above 37.5 degrees celsius.</li></ul></li><li>Advise social distancing for visitors and members.</li></ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Closing comments</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">There’s a lot of these statements going around, and it is a time of lots of news and statistics and a mix between panic and complacency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very high likelihood that we’ll have to shut the facility down completely in the coming weeks. Fortunately, we’re kinda used to that over the past year! If that’s the case we’ll be communicating both openly and privately with members to facilitate safely removing anything they might need from the space while instituting a full “lockdown”.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">In times like this, the physical building of Farset Labs is less important than the community; <strong>social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation</strong>. Whether you’re a member or not, stay connected on our <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Slack</a>, Share stuff that you think is cool on our <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Discourse</a>, and when open meetings come up, please dial in just to chill out.</p>



<p>Stay nerdy my friends.<br />the Farset Labs team</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meetups </h2>



<p><a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> is running meetups across Northern Ireland to bring the tech, creative, and public policy sectors together, so share their successes, failures, experiments and experiences, in order to build a shared understanding of how we can make the world, if not a better place, at least a more informed one!</p>



<p>Data Art has been operating as a community-run <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast">meetup group</a> since 2017, mostly based in <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs, Belfast</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to the support of the <a href="https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/open-data-ni-innovation-and-outreach-fund">Department of Finances OpenDataNI Advocacy fund</a>, we are taking the show on the road!</p>



<p>Venues and partners we plan on working with include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.vaultartiststudios.com/">Vault Artist Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalartsstudios.com/">Digital Arts Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/projects/immersive-labs/">Digital Catapult Immersive Labs, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bpw.org.uk/">Belfast Print Workshop, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thehubnewry.com/">The Hub, Newry</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre, Derry</a></li></ul>



<p>If you’d like to host <a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> in your venue, please get in touch with us at dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>



<p>(Also if you’d like to collaborate on running a local chapter of DataArt in your area…)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Workshops</h2>



<p>Meetups are only part of the puzzle; we need to learn how to handle the different facets of “Data Art”, and that takes more than a cursory presentation…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs</a> are hosting a series of technical and creative workshops to upskill technologists, creatives, and passionate amateurs in targeted capabilities to enable the acquisition, exploration, augmentation, and visualisation of data in one way or another.</p>



<p>This could (depending on interest displayed) include sessions on topics such as:</p>



<ul><li>Programming for Data Analysis</li><li>Embedded IoT for sensor acquisition and data visualisation</li><li>Machine Learning and Statistics</li><li>Geospatial Techniques and Analysis</li><li>Real-time Visualisation and Sonification</li><li>Typography and Graphic Design Fundamentals</li><li>Colour Theory and Interactive Visual Arts Design</li><li>3D Design / Game Development</li><li>Physical Programming (aka Knitting and Crocheting)</li></ul>



<p>But we want to listen to you! And we’ll be planning out the workshops with partners based on feedback received from the Meetups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hackathons</h2>



<p>Over the past years, Hackathons have become the ‘de-rigueur’ way of engaging with the technology community to showcase some technology, problem, or task to be crowdsourced or socialised, usually in exchange for an .</p>



<p>Rather than running a big, high end, one-off, 24 hour crunch-time hackathon, we are running a quarterly series of hackathons instead, all with the thread around the cleaning, use, analysis and ‘artification’ of open data to inform and excite.</p>



<p>This provides time to really understand processes, projects and experiments, and also for relevant data owners in local government to be able to react and engage with the data-user community through platforms like <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/">OpenDataNI</a>, and provide space to get real projects off the ground and make real change in our communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Open Data Innovation and Outreach Fund</strong></h2>



<p>We&#8217;re not the only ones being supported in this programme; Seven projects from Belfast, Derry and Newry have been successful from the £30,000 fund which encourages innovation in the reuse of data on the <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Data NI portal</a>.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.allstate.com/northern-ireland/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Allstate Northern Ireland</a> was awarded £2,500 in partnership with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Belfast City Council</a> to host hackathon events for the technology community and STEM students.</p>



<p>Also among the winners was Anaeko Limited, who received £3,000 to host events and marketing activities for entrepreneurs to develop sustainable business models leveraging Open Data.</p>



<p>Derry City and Strabane District Council in partnership with Carnegie UK Trust was awarded £3,000 to host cross sectoral workshops to tell the story of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon; Derry and Strabane; and Lisburn and Castlereagh Council council areas.</p>



<p>Newry 2020 received £4,995 to deliver an integrated environmental sensor network to assess the impact of human activities on the environment in Newry and £2,995 to host outreach events.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.xpandaccess.com/" target="_blank">Xpand Group</a> in partnership with Belfast City Council was awarded £4,960 to create a shared access platform to enable business case development and decision making for large scale regional projects, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://flaxandteal.co.uk/" target="_blank">Flax &amp; Teal Limited</a> received £5,000 to develop an environmental disaster simulation tool for use in education and emergency planning.</p>



<p>Northern Ireland&#8217;s Finance Minister&nbsp;<a href="http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/details.aspx?&amp;aff=13276&amp;per=80&amp;c=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conor Murphy</a>, who announced the winners, said: “This fund provides entrepreneurs and organisations with a real opportunity to use public sector data for commercial opportunities and drive future economic growth.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to meet the winners and hear more about the range of ingenious projects and events which will further develop digital skills while creating a culture of data transparency.</p>



<p>“It is encouraging to see the collaborative approach the winners have taken, working with community groups, businesses and local councils to optimise public sector data for research, outreach and innovation.”</p>



<p>Farset Labs is receiving £6,000 (as part of a budget of £11,000) to run the Data Art programme, including 6 Meetups, 6 Workshops and 4 Hackathons, and this budget allocation is directly to fund venue, refreshments, travel and equipment costs.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to participate in the programme or help run the project, join the Meetup Group below or contact dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk for more information.</p>

<p>TL;DR If there&#8217;s something that you think needs fixed/changed in Farset Labs, go to our somebody-should <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">Github Repo</a> and raise an issue.</p>



<p>Over the past 7 years, we&#8217;ve had Trello, Google Tasks, Asana, Trello Again, JIRA, Trello again and finally JIRA, as issue-management and tracking systems. All have had loads of bells and whistles and integrations and tracking workflows, and hardly any got used by the general membership to raise issues that were affecting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was living in Liverpool, I joined <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">DoESLivepool</a>. They have a very simple system that feeds in to not only their weeknotes bot, but also their machine booking and repair tracking system; a github repo that only stores issues, called <a href="https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should">somebody-should.</a></p>



<p>So, for the past month, we&#8217;ve been quietly switched over, referring people who raise issues in the Slack to raise an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">repo</a>, populating and processing a few sample issues, experimenting with milestones, and generally faffing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we&#8217;re &#8220;officially&#8221; announcing it. We&#8217;re still fiddling with some of the documentation, but as they say, no good plan survives contact with reality, so go raise some hell(ish issues).&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">If you can&#8217;t explain it to a six year old, you don&#8217;t understand it yourself. &#8211; Albert Einstein</h5>



<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a <strong>minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be running five sessions this year:</p>



<ul><li>12th September 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913730284?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913730284" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>14th November 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913731287?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913731287" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>9th January 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913732290?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913732290" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>13th March 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913733293?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913733293" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>8th May 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913734296?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913734296" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Theme:</h2>



<p>No themes this time, although if someone wants to suggest something crazy, get in touch!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Audience:</h2>



<p>The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. <strong>No topic is off limits</strong> as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to <strong>a lay audience</strong> within the constraints of the format.</p>



<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, hot food and fresh fruit intermission.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Rules:</h2>



<p>The rules for both groups are the same:</p>



<ul><li>Speakers have a maximum of <strong>7 minutes to speak</strong> on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li><li><strong>No Slides!</strong> The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li><li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to <strong>put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard</strong> along with their name.</li><li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!<br /></li></ul>



<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>



<p>See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After going through due process, the desk usage policy has been updated to: explicitly state that un-rented desks should be cleared after use; that members have the right to move equipment left on un-rented desks to communal storage areas; which desks are currently rented/hot-desk/communal; and implementing standard COSHH practices.<span id="more-2931"></span></p>
<p>Here at Farset Labs, we started off with a relatively simple, if comprehensive, sets of <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">Rules, Policies, and Codes of Conduct</a>, covering the use of the space, equipment in the space, and the guidelines that we as a community agree to abide to.</p>
<p>99% of these can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the space better than you found it.</li>
<li>Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sometimes it becomes necessary to be a little more explicit about the expectations of the wider community. Two issues that have been raised with the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/">management and director teams</a> occasionally but persistently since day one is &#8220;someone left a desk covered in junk, what do?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this desk rented?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://farsetlabs.slack.com/archives/C03G2CK5J/p1527063330000063">Around May time</a>, discussions in the Slack boiled up to a point where the Directorship and Management teams realised that for about a year we&#8217;d been discussing a &#8220;Clear Desk Policy&#8221; that we were absolutely sure we definitely, definitely, had one that said &#8220;clear up your stuff when your done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oops.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>So, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koEeVoujnw3RIsW0fy_TxjXLvebNwtC0V7OWSbBGKZY/edit#heading=h.ljhyi1zcfx4r">June Town Hall</a>, I raised <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Gbpx3m7K2IdUzjPjvuPLP4QbLGaG3riKGkQPGybypQ/edit#slide=id.p">a proposal</a> to address a few simultaneous issues around &#8216;where should be clear, who should clear it, and where can I put stuff?&#8217;. This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.</p>
<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling. We have since day one had an explicit exclusion on firearms/ammunition , explosives, Offensive weapons, Unlicensed radio equipment, large quantities of combustibles, inflammables, or pressurised gases, stolen equipment, or banned substances. However, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed from the <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/f90919fa0711f5e816a2f2252912d0bbd8ab4860#diff-d39a174faa68201faf0c6caaf6c912ba">old rules</a>, &#8216;large quantities&#8217; was never defined, so naturally we eventually got a couple of reports of members effectively bulk buying both high end solvents and pressurised containers on the cheap, and stashing them in boxes somewhere&#8230; So David Kane and Colin Kelsey took on the task in writing up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8u9mFUWM5no0mWuirTc53Zq5wBjiHrlaIC0Z-wNEOQ/edit">their own proposal</a> to expand and extend the coverage of our COSHH policies, that was similarly unanimously ratified at the June Town Hall.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of behind the scenes process; that doesn&#8217;t mean in &#8216;Farset Land&#8217; that the new rules came in to force; just that the community had agreed in principal to the rough outlines; the proposal still needed to be turned in to the actual changes required in the Rules, Policy&#8217;s and Codes of Conduct to bring them up to speed with the proposal; if it&#8217;s not <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">on the website</a> it&#8217;s not a real rule.</p>
<p>Since moving our website to <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/tree/21817e4c38c251fa5149f7cc8574e0322c8757f0">Github hosted Markdown in 2013</a>, any changes to &#8216;the rules&#8217; have been recorded and mostly Pull-Request/Reviewed as part of the ratification process in order to be as open as possible. We&#8217;re not always perfect at this but we&#8217;re getting better about being as transparent and open as possible and not just rushing through rule changes without consultation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/165">COSHH pull request</a> was relatively simple to review and merge as it was mostly technical and &#8216;edge case&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/164">Desk Rental pull request</a> was a bit more complex, with members of the community collaborating and beating out the policy changes to cover any edge cases, and was signed off on at last nights&#8217; Town Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant&#8221; changes in this policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently-Rented Hot-Desks, are indicated as in red on the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">Facilities page</a>, and it is the responsibility of the Directors and NEMs to keep this up to date.</li>
<li>Any desks labeled in green in the facilities diagram are available for Rental</li>
<li>All Green and Blue desks are subject to a clear desk policy, which means these desks must be cleared of all equipment (on or under) before leaving the space</li>
<li>Any equipment left unattended at such desks can be moved by any member to common storage facilities.</li>
<li>Two desks in the workshop are being opened up to being rented.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to thank the members who made it out last week to blitz and &#8220;defrag&#8221; the whole space; it&#8217;s survived a week without turning back in to a tip which is always a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="VID 20180730 WA0003 2" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQMmesROYK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s a little notification/story from the governance of Farset; as a reminder, Town Halls are held on the first Monday of the month in the Event Space at 7pm and are open to both members and interested-non members (however non-members can&#8217;t vote). A lot of Farsets&#8217; day-to-day governance <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">is handled in our Slack</a>, which, again, is open to both members and non-members.</p>
<p>If there are any questions or ideas about how governance is handled, we&#8217;re more than happy for those to be discussed publicly on Github or Slack, or privately by emailing info@farsetlabs.org.uk, or admin@farsetlabs.org.uk if there is something sensitive to be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Department of Communities &#8220;Creativity Month 2018&#8221;, Farset are coordinating two workshop-style events this year, continuing our now 5 year track record of delivering awesome weirdness! Bog Standard and IdeaJam, both kindly supported by the <a href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/">Department of Communities NI</a></p>
<h1><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ideajam-tickets-44071792919">IdeaJam</a></h1>
<p><strong>Ideas. We’ve all got ‘em, rattling around in our busy, distracted heads.</strong></p>
<p>On <em>Saturday 31st March, 10am &#8211; 10pm</em>, Farset Labs will host <strong>IDEA JAM</strong> – a chance for creators, designers and developers to clear all distractions and finally sculpt that secret, nebulous idea you’ve been chipping away at for years into that&#8217;s ready to pitch and take it to the next level.</p>
<p>You might be harbouring a business, a novel, a video game, a TV pilot, a children’s book or a screenplay… it’s there, hiding behind grocery lists, bank statements and status updates.</p>
<p>It’s time to finally get that idea out of your head and into the world, so you can actually do something real with it.</p>
<p>Artists, developers and other screen industry experts will be on hand to help transfer your concept from brain to pitch, whether it’s a story arc, synopsis, sketch or sizzle reel&#8230; and maybe even tell you where to take it next.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>The schedule is pretty informal, as this is <strong>your</strong> time for <strong>your </strong>idea. Meals will be catered through the day, starting with breakfast at<strong> 9:30am</strong>. Industry mentors with experience of pitching business, film and game concepts will be available from <strong>10:00am</strong> to guide you in fleshing out your idea into something that you can pitch and develop.</p>
<p>By <strong>10:00pm</strong> your goal is to have your concept realised, and even ready to pitch to others!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ideajam-tickets-44071792919"><strong>Book your seat now!</strong></a></p>
<h1><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bog-standard-tickets-43925335862">Bog Standard &#8211; Rethinking the Humble Bathroom</a></h1>
<p><em>Thus 22nd March, 5:30pm &#8211; 10pm</em></p>
<p>How would you build a better bog? What factors go into improving a service or product?</p>
<p>Design thinking is a buzz phrase that is often thrown around, but what does it really mean? This evening workshop applies design thinking concepts in a concrete manner; exploring the design considerations of the humble bathroom.</p>
<p>Through iterative explorations facilitated by experienced Design Thinking Practitioners, and the use of empathy generating techniques and ideation tools; a mix of attendees from all backgrounds will be encouraged to explore the impact of changing societal, technical and practical needs in a familiar context, all while additional &#8220;Chaos Factors&#8221; are added over the course of the evening to keep things interesting!</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />
<i>Please note: </i>You must be over 18 on the 26th of January in order to participate.</p>
<p class="p1">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a> or ask us questions via <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a> </span>or <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a> with the #farsetggj18 hashtag.</p>
