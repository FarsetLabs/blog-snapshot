<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Global Game Jam is back in the building to kick-off the new year!</strong><br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">Register your seat now!</a></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>&nbsp;at Farset Labs is back again in 2020, with support from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/" target="_blank">Northern Ireland Screen</a>. The Game Jam will run <strong>from Friday 31st January to Sunday 2nd February</strong> &#8211; come meet some great people and develop a game idea in a weekend. With a party atmosphere from Friday night, there will be plenty of people there to team up with, create something interesting and (most importantly) to have fun!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>



<p>A global simultaneous&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hackathon&nbsp;</a>making games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as table-top board- and card-games. Some will be just for fun, others for charitable causes like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games For Change</a>, and none of them exist before this weekend!</p>



<p><strong>Farset Labs</strong> has been running Northern Ireland’s largest regular public GGJ site since&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank">2013</a>, this year joining over 100 other countries taking part. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the weekend, and there will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam listing</a>.</p>



<p><strong>HOW DO I ENTER?</strong></p>



<p>We ask that you <strong>reserve your seat</strong> at Farset Labs <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">on Eventbrite</a>, so that we can get accurate numbers for our food orders (included in your registration).</p>



<p>You can then complete your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam registration</a>&nbsp;on or <strong>before Friday 31st January</strong>.</p>



<p>Global Game Jam is always very popular; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</p>



<p>Registration this year is <strong>£5.99 per person</strong> &#8211; registration will reserve your seat for the weekend as well as helping us to provide you with catered meals for the full weekend and unique GGJ Belfast goodies!</p>



<p>The theme is announced on-site at <strong>5pm on Friday 31st January</strong> so we recommend everyone be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on. We look forward to seeing you all, as it will be a great weekend!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>



<p>There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>



<p><em>Please note:</em>&nbsp;<strong>You must be over 18</strong> on the 31st of January to participate.</p>



<p>More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact&nbsp;<a href="http://mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>&nbsp;or ask us questions via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter&nbsp;</a>with the&nbsp;<strong>#farsetggj20</strong>&nbsp;hashtag.</p>

<p>Greetings members&nbsp;and friends!<br />Time to hack together some comfort foods and share them with others!</p>



<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and&nbsp;swapping stories of your 2018.<br />No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come with&nbsp;us&nbsp;so far.<br />There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorative&nbsp;decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />The date for this is Saturday 15th December, from 7pm to 10pm. We can carry on as we see fit!</p>



<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>



<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: £3)</p>



<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We will&nbsp;have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them and a little fridge space, however there is obviously very limited space for cooking on-site.</p>



<p>For more information, join us on the <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Slack</a>.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>.

You can make a comic by yourself or with partner/s from Saturday 6th @ 3pm to Sunday 7th @ 3pm at Farset Labs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/comicbookguysfinallogo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2962" width="156" height="127" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/comicbookguysfinallogo.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/comicbookguysfinallogo-300x244.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" /></figure></div>



<p>The event is being supported by <a href="http://www.comicbookguys.co.uk">Comic Book Guys</a>, who are currently packing prize bags and will have some limited edition <a href="https://www.previewsworld.com/Article/216608-DC-Has-Three-Blank-Comic-Books-In-Time-For-24-Hour-Comics-Day">24HCD DC Comics templates</a> to use.</p>

<p><strong>The Rules?</strong><br />The Rules ask for 24 consecutive pages in 24 consecutive hours. To reflect different levels of ability and commitment we&#8217;re hosting a sketchier approach &#8211; take your idea as far as you can. Comic Book Guys will be providing incentives for those who make 8 hours, 16 hours and the full 24.</p>



<p><strong>No planning!</strong><br />Think of ideas.. whisper them.. but your pen shouldn&#8217;t touch the page until the clock starts.

<p><strong>Try not to die!</strong><br />Prolonged exposure to making comics could have a hallucinatory effect &#8211; we encourage everyone to make a marathon effort, but if it stops being fun&#8230; stop.<br />You may also want to read the <a href="http://blitzcomics.com/go/content/resources">24HCD Survival Guide</a> created by Blitz Comics.</p>



<p><strong>The Theme</strong><br />No theme, but we may have a surprise prompt on the day.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good merry-tide once again, members and friends!<br />
The season of wintry victuals is upon us once more, so start with the heart of all things hacky!</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and swapping stories of your 2017.<br />
No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come with us so far.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorative decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />
The date for this is Saturday 9th December (at 7pm).</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: £3)</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />
Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We will have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them (the oven has gone to the great white-goods store in the sky&#8230;) however there is obviously limited space for cooking on-site.</p>

<p><b>HOW DO I ENTER?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask that you <strong>reserve your seat at Farset Labs</strong> using our Meetup.com page at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Farset-Labs-Events/events/236020828/">meetup.com/Farset-Labs-Events</a> &#8211; entry is free for everyone!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam is always very popular; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</span></p>

<p><b>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam is a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the </span><a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games For Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement.  There are already a number of large </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 480 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since </span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/farset-labs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good merry-tide once again, members and friends!<br />
The Christmas season has come early this year, as we have made adjustments to ensure you can start it interesting!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Do let us know you&#8217;re coming via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/584209385112871/">Facebook</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and swapping stories of your 2016.<br />
No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come with us so far.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorative decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />
The date for this is Friday 2nd December (at 7pm).</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: £3)</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />
Easy to share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the easiest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better!  We will have  microwaves and hot-plates in the kitchen if you need them (plus an oven, for now&#8230;) however there is obviously limited space for cooking on-site.<br />
For more information, join us on the Farset Slack or Discourse.</p>
