										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further to our survey, undertaken in January 2016, we can now reveal the results, and our planned actions to improve!</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: All worded responses are included, except where such a response identified the respondent.</span></i></p>
<hr />
<h1> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General</span></h1>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2713" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1-300x125.png" alt="1" width="660" height="275" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1-300x125.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This question was intended to gather basic data regarding how frequently members use the space. It’s heartening to see that 75%+ of respondents use the space more than once per week. Hopefully as we work to improve the space further, we’ll see this number increase.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2714" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2-300x123.png" alt="2" width="661" height="271" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2-300x123.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2.png 711w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This question was again to gather basic data on space usage. The response is largely as expected, and should help us ensure that we’re providing services and planning events at the right times.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2715" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-300x118.png" alt="3" width="658" height="259" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-300x118.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3.png 702w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another basic usage question, and again no big surprises. There’s an interesting correlation between usage and investment, though it’s hard to say if this is cause or effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to invest further in improving the lounge, with our intention being to make it more suitable as a meeting room (Without sacrificing the lounge aspect!) </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administration</span></h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2716" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4-300x119.png" alt="4" width="658" height="261" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4.png 707w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results here are interesting; when compared to our own accounting data, we can see that students are underrepresented in the survey. Roughly 80% of freelancers have responded, whereas only 50% of students have done so. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2717" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-300x123.png" alt="5" width="656" height="269" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-300x123.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5.png 701w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of membership data is encouraging. It indicates both a good member retention, and a sizeable number of new members joining the community.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2718" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6-300x119.png" alt="6" width="658" height="261" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this chart, 1 represents ‘Much too Cheap’, and 5 represents ‘Much too Expensive’. It’s encouraging to see that more members think we’re undercharging than overcharging!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When compared to other spaces across the UK, our rates are very favourable for our size and facilities. We don’t currently intend to revise our membership fees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses:</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I am there during the day, I seem to have only the freelancer option, but for 3-4 days per month, when I am using my own laptop and could work elsewhere, another option would be appreciated :s</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset is awesome.</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t get in often so feel it is expensive. Some hackerspaces offer pay-what-you-feel-you-use, I think that is appropriate for evening access</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s evidently important that we clarify the wording of our membership and pricing structure. Our ‘Freelancer’ scheme is intended to be a voluntary donation on top of standard fees, based on a member’s self-assessed usage of the space. ‘Freelancer’ membership is not required for daytime use of the space. Additionally, we implemented fees for daily use several months ago, but evidently this needs publicised more. The Day Pass fees stand, at £5 a day, or £3 for an evening (after 5pm). Our fees are all listed online, but we’ll make these clearer. We will improve the advertising of membership fees within the building itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanliness of the space has long been an issue, so it’s good to see that the scores are higher than expected. In the last year, we’ve improved the frequency of our bin collections, and organised the collection of glass. The space is now also cleaned weekly by an external cleaner, so cleanliness should continue to improve. Members can do their bit by ensuring they follow the clear desk policy, and by leaving the space a little cleaner than they found it on every visit. Cleaning supplies and bin liners etc are always available under the kitchen sink and we have recently put up new signage to clarify the bin locations.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2720" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8-300x116.png" alt="8" width="659" height="255" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8-300x116.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8.png 710w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping the space in a good state of repair is one of our top priorities, so it’s good to see that members think we’re doing well! Some aspects of the building are maintained by ourselves, and others by the landlord. To help us keep things running, please report breakages and faults to us ( </span><a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ) as soon as you encounter them. If we don’t know something is broken, we can’t get it fixed.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2721" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9-300x119.png" alt="9" width="658" height="261" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fairly even spread of responses to this question. It’s worth noting that the Event Space has a large number of tables and chairs, and offers similar connectivity to the co-working space, should it be full.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laser cutter is clearly the most requested item on this list. Assuming those who want a death ray will settle for a laser cutter, this gives six individual requests. A laser cutter is something we’re investigating right now, but the equipment isn’t cheap, with reasonable solutions costing in the range of £10-15k. We’re looking into how to afford such a machine, and how we can afford to maintain it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment such as band saws are where things get rather difficult from a safety perspective. We’ll be looking into the possibility of such equipment, but it’s unlikely at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other equipment requested will be placed on our (ever growing) shopping list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses:</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workspace is easy to find, equipment isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s often vanished (ie. stolen) or moved, or difficult to find in the first place. (Obvs this isn&#8217;t a dig at management!)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conor did an awesome job making the space habitable.</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few times I have noticed offers of paid / sponsored use passed up, seemingly for straightforwardness rather than idealogical or practical reasons &#8211; while this obviously takes volunteer effort, having a slightly clearer and more efficient fee structure / guidelines could save users time, offset subs, and encourage wider use and community engagement</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do the best we can to locate and replace missing equipment, but often we aren’t informed until months after equipment disappears. Members can do their part to help by letting us know when something goes missing. That way we can search through CCTV, or order a replacement. Please be aware that removing equipment from the space without permission is strictly prohibited. Members found to be removing Farset property, or that belonging to other members, will be asked to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to paid use of the space, we consider all requests equally. We will seek to clarify the space booking fees.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2722" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/10-300x124.png" alt="10" width="658" height="272" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/10-300x124.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/10.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No surprises here, we have a very capable internet connection at present, courtesy of </span><a href="https://www.tibus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re currently getting the line upgraded to 200Mb fibre, though. Anyone who doesn’t give 5/5 next time around will be hunted down.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2723" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11-300x117.png" alt="11" width="659" height="257" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11.png 715w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliability of the internet connection varies, and we’re currently working on improving this through use of new switchgear. This should be implemented around the same time as the fibre installation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2724" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12-300x125.png" alt="12" width="660" height="275" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12-300x125.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12.png 701w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This question has returned the worst feedback in the survey, and it’s no surprise. One of the main problems we have with our printing system (using Google Cloudprint) is that the host machine (which also hosts the reception display) often updates/is logged out/is turned off. This kills the print.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re currently looking into replacing the print server with a Raspberry Pi (also running cloudprint), that should be harder to meddle with. All being well, this will greatly increase the reliability of the printers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with other reliability issues, any failures should be reported ( </span><a href="mailto:tech@farsetlabs.org.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ) so that we know they need to be fixed. </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPN, VPS, and Storage services are currently under development, as is improved documentation of existing services. This was a long term issue as we’ve flipped between several different documentation / FAQ frameworks, but after a long run, we’re back to using wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk as a general knowledgebase and leaving long-term / policy issues on the static website. It’s still being worked on and we’d welcome suggestions or submissions!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D scanning will be considered, depending on the interest from the membership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports massages may be a longer term goal, and cocktail urges will need to be quenched at our tuck shop for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events</span></h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2725" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/13-300x120.png" alt="13" width="660" height="264" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/13-300x120.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/13.png 695w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong trend towards positive responses. This can confidently be put down to the consistent hard work of Glenn, our events NEM. Thank you!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2726" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14-300x118.png" alt="14" width="658" height="259" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14-300x118.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14.png 707w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More positive responses here, again to Glenn’s credit. It’s worth pointing out that members can organise events of their own. It’s strongly encouraged! If there’s a type of event you think we should run, by all means get in touch and help us do it!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses:</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do we have anyone who&#8217;s &#8216;job&#8217; it is to go out and attract more meetup groups? Takes time, I know, but also a potentially good driver of membership</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glen rocks</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got a million times better since Glenn! Figuring out how to get members to start their own would be a massive victory (but hard :()</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">More group learning or even lightning talk sessions would be very good</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We welcome meetup groups who wish to make use of our Wednesday evening slots, but since there are only so many Wednesday evenings in a month, we’re kept pretty busy with such groups. Membership resulting from meetup groups has typically been low. Since the slots are already busy, and such group events are hosted for free, we’re not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing for more right now.</span></p>

<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community</span></h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2727" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/15-300x136.png" alt="15" width="660" height="299" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/15-300x136.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/15.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another ‘basic data’ type question. It’s interesting to see that Slack is the most used option, though perhaps this is simply showing that those who use slack were more likely to respond to the survey. Blog posts are generally used for “official”, canonical announcements which are then shared through other channels.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2728" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16-300x115.png" alt="16" width="660" height="253" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16-300x115.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16.png 710w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this question, we can see that our frequency of communications is about right. If anything, we need to publicise what we’re doing a little more! Hopefully this will be improved by the new Weeknotes system.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2729" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/17-300x123.png" alt="17" width="661" height="271" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/17-300x123.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/17.png 704w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again a fairly wide spread, but there’s a trend towards positive responses. We’ll be reviewing how well we’re publicising our contact information, and adding an anonymous feedback form to our website in an effort to improve this further.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2730" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/18-300x114.png" alt="18" width="661" height="251" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/18-300x114.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/18.png 714w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good trend towards positive responses here! Since events are well advertised and kept on our </span><a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and since NEM and Director roles are advertised to the community, this is somewhat expected. We’ll keep doing what we’re doing, making sure that members are informed of new events and opportunities to get involved.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2731" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19-300x118.png" alt="19" width="661" height="260" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19-300x118.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19.png 706w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very strong response here! We’ll look into starting such an event. The suggestion made below regarding non-members is a perfectly valid one, we’ll look into how such an event could be opened up to non-members through our standard event ticket fee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Suggestions:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open social night, lightning talks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy with community led events.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie nights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find alcohol to be a fine social lubricant.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monthly social event would be great but I&#8217;d like to be able to bring, and meet, non-members.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s get together an evening a month and work on the space, we can build both physical and virtual stuff.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses:</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one seems to take any kind of lead in integrating new members into the community.</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">recurse.com has some interesting ideas, eg. for a beginning/intermediate software developer wanting to &#8220;level up&#8221; (https://www.recurse.com/)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need more project documentation content (hacknotes style)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point regarding new members’ induction is an issue we’ve been talking about for a long time but has been difficult to nail down in terms of scheduling, and format. Our Community NEM is currently looking at how to resolve these remaining issues so we can get regular induction / social nights up and running as soon as possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help us understand the needs of our member base, and to point us toward the areas we need to improve upon, we&#8217;ve come up with a short member survey for the New Year. This contains questions regarding each of our management areas, and should help us to improve Farset Labs to better serve you.</p>
<p>The survey is open to all members, regardless of membership duration or level. (Management included!)</p>
<p>All active members have been emailed with this survey, and so far roughly 50% have responded. It&#8217;s quite possible that some of the email addresses we&#8217;ve used are old and inactive, however. <strong>If you&#8217;re a current member and haven&#8217;t already received a link to our survey, please email us (admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) and let us know!</strong></p>
<p>The survey will close at <strong>Midnight on Tuesday 19th January</strong>. Once the survey closes, the results will be published, along with our plans!</p>
