										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again! We&#8217;re happy to announce that the next instalment of our popular event series Gathering of Lightning will take place on Thursday 28th August at 6:30pm.</p>
<p>A series of speakers will have a maximum of 7 minutes to give an only-slightly-prepared speech/rant/eulogy on anything they feel strongly about. Audience participation is encouraged and speakers should be aware of foam-projectiles heading their way if they dare go over their time limit.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8220589658_771ceeb8ed_c.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="219" />Past talks have ranged from wearable tech to beer to quantum mechanics to baking and we&#8217;re sure this lineup will be just as strange and wonderful. So far we&#8217;ve got our old regular, Daniel Porter ranting about something as yet undecided between the new Farset management system, and his Quake-net setup at this years QCon, Owen McEvoy talking about the launch of a brilliant Belfast based ethically sourced foods cooperative, and Sarah McBride from the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/culturetechfest/create-2014-a-creative-conference-made-by-young-pe">Create:2014</a> team talking about their kickstarter-funded conference. On the &#8216;maybe&#8217; list we have Jenni from <a href="http://www.tascomi.com/">Tascomi</a> ranting about parenting technically saavy children and Martin from <a href="http://www.gilchristandco.com/">Gilchrist&amp;Co</a> talking about his Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/662615347/accountsify-as-in-clarify-simplify-accountsify">Accountisfy</a>, along with the usual walk-in types we know and love!</p>
<p>Oh and if you&#8217;re not already convinced, we&#8217;ll be serving beer and pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1622" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/13703923935_2b9a4c287a_b-300x2001.jpg" alt="13703923935_2b9a4c287a_b" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Last weekend we celebrated Farset Labs&#8217; second birthday, and the arrival of our newest corporate member Intel, in traditional fashion: we threw a hackathon. Intel brought down a bunch of their new <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html">Galileo boards</a>, a huge selection of components and the ever-necessary beer and snacks.</p>
<p>With the ingredients in place for some serious hacking, we kicked-off with Intel&#8217;s Mark Corkery giving a quick talk on the company and their focus on developing the <em>internet of things, </em>spurring the teams to get stuck into figuring these boards out.</p>
<p>As expected with such a new piece of kit, much of the initial few hours was spent working out how to use the thing. A round of applause was deservedly given to Team Magee shortly before 11pm when they announced they&#8217;d not only connected the board to the internet but also got SSH into it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1638 alignright" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled-1-300x2711.jpg" alt="Untitled-1" width="198" height="179" /></p>
<p>Working through the night the teams uncovered a <a href="http://ccc.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/en/news/40">Yocto image from Intel Taiwan</a> which contained many useful pieces of software precompiled and suddenly the capabilities of the board increased exponentially.</p>
<p>However lady fate saw things going a little too swimmingly and suddenly our Ultimaker 3D printer decided to put a thorn in the competing teams plans by refusing to print. Team Magee were especially hard hit as their project required bespoke valves designed using 3D modelling software.</p>
<p><span id="more-1616"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1619 alignleft" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/13703983245_a726496fde_b-300x2001.jpg" alt="13703983245_a726496fde_b" width="243" height="162" /></p>
<p>After a shout out on our social media channels a member came to the rescue and the design was printed, albeit too late to be integrated into their hack.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone had a great weekend and we&#8217;d like to thank the guys at Intel for introducing themselves with a bang. Several new project ideas came out of it and we can&#8217;t wait to get started on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Projects</h2>
<h5>Team Magee: Hardware</h5>
<p>Team Magee designed a machine that allowed customers to order drinks via <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. The hardware team attached a Galileo to a pump, some piping and taps, so four individual bottles could be pressurised. The system brought liquid from the bottles and out the tap on demand. We&#8217;re hoping to see the team back in the space soon to taste test some of their cocktails!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/morph/13704011625/"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1620 aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3778/13704011625_1a5b64583a.jpg" alt="13704011625_1a5b64583a_b" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<h5>Team Magee: Software</h5>
<p>The software team worked on setting-up a Galileo to read the <a href="https://twitter.com/GalileoDrink">bot&#8217;s Twitter stream</a> and send commands to the hardware depending on the input. During judging they showcased the scary amount of hidden data put out alongside tweets and talked about how they could use this information in future iterations of their hack.</p>
<h5>Seek and Discomfort</h5>
<p>If there was a prize for most ambitious project it would&#8217;ve gone to this one. Seek &amp; Discomfort aimed to create an autonomous drone using the Galileo and write software such that you could play a game of hide and seek with your scary robot friend. As expected most of the night was spent playing with the AR Drone (who can blame them?) but they&#8217;ve promised they&#8217;ll get around to hacking sometime soon.</p>
<h5>Cloak of Many Colours</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright" style="line-height: 1.5em;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5118/13703970643_c083ce3252.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="120" />Resident hacker Robin hoped to further his prototype ping pong table, that lights up in response to acoustic vibrations from the ball hitting the table. He planned to adapt it into a stage costume. Unfortunately the components included in the board meant it wasn&#8217;t completely suitable but we sure had <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">fun looking at the pretty colours!</span></p>
<h5>Galileo Gamepad</h5>
<p>Rob Ellis arrived on the last day but impressively managed to use a joystick shield to create a galileo gamepad and used this as a means of controlling a character in his<a href="http://ammacentre.org/blog/?p=1602"> award winning game. </a></p>
<h5>Rotating Galileo Camera</h5>
<p>Andrew hoped to use the Galileo to control a camera mounted on a robotic arm. Unfortunately his genius became too widely known and he spent most of his time helping out other teams! He did manage to get <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> to compile on the board, an achievement in itself.</p>
<h5>Other</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2837/13703645993_671f7a9051.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="128" />There were some non-Galileo hacks too. We welcomed Bolster back for the weekend, arriving more beard than man. He got stuck into working on the new Farset website and member resources with the help of Ben. Chris also put the finishing touches to our new member management system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was great to see so many awesome projects and enthusiastic hackers. We never know how these things will go or what will come out of them, but time after time we&#8217;re amazed by the crazy stuff people come up with. Next time, no matter what skills or background you have, leave your preconceptions at the door and join us&#8230;</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1544" alt="intel_galileo-590x330" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/intel_galileo-590x330-300x1671.jpg" width="300" height="167" />The Galileo development board, is a Linux based microcontroller that’s compatible with <a href="http://hothardware.com/Tags/arduino.aspx" target="_blank">Arduino</a> software and shields and uses the new <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Demos-14nm-Broadwell-Processor-Worlds-First-22nm-Smartphone-and-Unveils-Quark-X1000-SoC-Open-Architecture-at-IDF13/" target="_blank">Quark X1000 SoC</a> processor (400MHz, 32-bit, Pentium-class, single- core and thread) that <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Demos-14nm-Broadwell-Processor-Worlds-First-22nm-Smartphone-and-Unveils-Quark-X1000-SoC-Open-Architecture-at-IDF13/" target="_blank">Intel announced at the IDF 2013 keynote</a>. Galileo is just 10cm x 7cm (although ports protrude a bit beyond that), and there are four screw holes for secure mounting. Ports include 10/100 <a id="KonaLink1" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">Ethernet</span></a>, USB client/host ports, RS-232 UART and 3.5mm jack, mini <a href="http://hothardware.com/Tags/pcie.aspx" target="_blank">PCIe</a> slot (with USB 2.0 host support); other features include 8MB Legacy SPI Flash for firmware storage, 512KB embedded SRAM, 256MB <a id="KonaLink2" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">DRAM</span></a>, 11KB EEPROM programmed via the EEPROM library, and support for an extra 32GB of storage using a <a id="KonaLink3" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">microSD</span></a> card.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Friday 4th April 18:00 &#8211; Saturday 5th April 18:00</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Farset+Labs/@54.5928524,-5.9400343,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x486108f686ba0491:0xf206df9d70d81d76" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> in our recently refurbished event space. To fuel the hacking we&#8217;ll be providing breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>Each team taking part in the Galileo section of the event is given a <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/galileo/galileo-overview.html" target="_blank">board</a> to develop on (which each team can fight over to take home!). Then everyone gets access to the Lab&#8217;s toy box of peripherals, components, prototyping equipment and tools to build something inspiring / cool / insane / useful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the event each team will be able to present the result of their hackery and our super savvy judging team will award a yet-to-be-decided prize to the best project.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you don&#8217;t want to compete and just want to hack on other projects that&#8217;s cool too. The rest of <a title="Who We Are" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/about-farset/" target="_blank">Farset&#8217;s Facilities</a> will be still open to experimentation and fiddling as usual.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As if anyone needs a reason to hack. Just in case &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s our <a title="Still Alive" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/still-alive/">second</a> birthday,</li>
<li>Intel have come aboard as a <a title="Please Welcome Intel to the Farset Family" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/please-welcome-intel-to-the-farset-family/">corporate member </a></li>
<li>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a> was still floating around he&#8217;d have been 450 in April.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1565" alt="hl" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hl1.jpg" width="200" height="172" /></a>I want in! </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s a limited number of spaces available so all attendees must preregister on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/galileo-hack-farset-labs-intel-hackathon-tickets-10922745225">Eventbrite</a>, the sooner you register the sooner you can save a seat and start forming your A-Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Intel have launched an instance on their recently acquired hacker league platform for us, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">sign up here</a>. In order to take part in the Galileo competition you must set up or join a project team on HackerLeague with &#8220;Galileo&#8221; in the name. Even if you have no idea what you&#8217;re going to do with it yet, we need to control the number of Galileo teams somehow and prizes may be awarded for the best name!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re particularly excited about this one, the space has been going through a lot of changes (ahem <em>upgrades</em>) and it&#8217;ll be great to get back to what we do best; hacking around with a bunch of great kit to play with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone </strong>planning to attend <strong>must</strong> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/galileo-hack-farset-labs-intel-hackathon-tickets-10922745225">register on the Eventbrite</a></li>
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> attending <strong>can</strong> <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">register on the Hacker League</a> to join or set up teams or projects</li>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> who wants to play with the Galileo and enter the competitions <strong>must</strong> <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">register on the Hacker League</a> <strong>and </strong>create or join a project with &#8220;Galileo&#8221; in the name</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Hacking</p>
