<p><a href="https://dataartni.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art Northern Ireland</a> is a community of technologists, artists, policy makers and other creatives that regularly come together to show, tell and learn about the collision of Data and Art.</p>



<p>Learn about visualisation techniques, data aggregation, and where to get data sources to create, inform, and excite.</p>



<p>If you want to get involved, join our Meetup Group to be first to hear when we release our schedule of events.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meetups </h2>



<p><a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> is running meetups across Northern Ireland to bring the tech, creative, and public policy sectors together, so share their successes, failures, experiments and experiences, in order to build a shared understanding of how we can make the world, if not a better place, at least a more informed one!</p>



<p>Data Art has been operating as a community-run <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast">meetup group</a> since 2017, mostly based in <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs, Belfast</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to the support of the <a href="https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/open-data-ni-innovation-and-outreach-fund">Department of Finances OpenDataNI Advocacy fund</a>, we are taking the show on the road!</p>



<p>Venues and partners we plan on working with include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.vaultartiststudios.com/">Vault Artist Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalartsstudios.com/">Digital Arts Studios, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/projects/immersive-labs/">Digital Catapult Immersive Labs, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bpw.org.uk/">Belfast Print Workshop, Belfast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thehubnewry.com/">The Hub, Newry</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre, Derry</a></li></ul>



<p>If you’d like to host <a href="https://dataartni.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Art NI</a> in your venue, please get in touch with us at dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>



<p>(Also if you’d like to collaborate on running a local chapter of DataArt in your area…)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Workshops</h2>



<p>Meetups are only part of the puzzle; we need to learn how to handle the different facets of “Data Art”, and that takes more than a cursory presentation…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs</a> are hosting a series of technical and creative workshops to upskill technologists, creatives, and passionate amateurs in targeted capabilities to enable the acquisition, exploration, augmentation, and visualisation of data in one way or another.</p>



<p>This could (depending on interest displayed) include sessions on topics such as:</p>



<ul><li>Programming for Data Analysis</li><li>Embedded IoT for sensor acquisition and data visualisation</li><li>Machine Learning and Statistics</li><li>Geospatial Techniques and Analysis</li><li>Real-time Visualisation and Sonification</li><li>Typography and Graphic Design Fundamentals</li><li>Colour Theory and Interactive Visual Arts Design</li><li>3D Design / Game Development</li><li>Physical Programming (aka Knitting and Crocheting)</li></ul>



<p>But we want to listen to you! And we’ll be planning out the workshops with partners based on feedback received from the Meetups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hackathons</h2>



<p>Over the past years, Hackathons have become the ‘de-rigueur’ way of engaging with the technology community to showcase some technology, problem, or task to be crowdsourced or socialised, usually in exchange for an .</p>



<p>Rather than running a big, high end, one-off, 24 hour crunch-time hackathon, we are running a quarterly series of hackathons instead, all with the thread around the cleaning, use, analysis and ‘artification’ of open data to inform and excite.</p>



<p>This provides time to really understand processes, projects and experiments, and also for relevant data owners in local government to be able to react and engage with the data-user community through platforms like <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/">OpenDataNI</a>, and provide space to get real projects off the ground and make real change in our communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Open Data Innovation and Outreach Fund</strong></h2>



<p>We&#8217;re not the only ones being supported in this programme; Seven projects from Belfast, Derry and Newry have been successful from the £30,000 fund which encourages innovation in the reuse of data on the <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Data NI portal</a>.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.allstate.com/northern-ireland/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Allstate Northern Ireland</a> was awarded £2,500 in partnership with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Belfast City Council</a> to host hackathon events for the technology community and STEM students.</p>



<p>Also among the winners was Anaeko Limited, who received £3,000 to host events and marketing activities for entrepreneurs to develop sustainable business models leveraging Open Data.</p>



<p>Derry City and Strabane District Council in partnership with Carnegie UK Trust was awarded £3,000 to host cross sectoral workshops to tell the story of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon; Derry and Strabane; and Lisburn and Castlereagh Council council areas.</p>



<p>Newry 2020 received £4,995 to deliver an integrated environmental sensor network to assess the impact of human activities on the environment in Newry and £2,995 to host outreach events.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.xpandaccess.com/" target="_blank">Xpand Group</a> in partnership with Belfast City Council was awarded £4,960 to create a shared access platform to enable business case development and decision making for large scale regional projects, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://flaxandteal.co.uk/" target="_blank">Flax &amp; Teal Limited</a> received £5,000 to develop an environmental disaster simulation tool for use in education and emergency planning.</p>



<p>Northern Ireland&#8217;s Finance Minister&nbsp;<a href="http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/details.aspx?&amp;aff=13276&amp;per=80&amp;c=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conor Murphy</a>, who announced the winners, said: “This fund provides entrepreneurs and organisations with a real opportunity to use public sector data for commercial opportunities and drive future economic growth.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to meet the winners and hear more about the range of ingenious projects and events which will further develop digital skills while creating a culture of data transparency.</p>



<p>“It is encouraging to see the collaborative approach the winners have taken, working with community groups, businesses and local councils to optimise public sector data for research, outreach and innovation.”</p>



<p>Farset Labs is receiving £6,000 (as part of a budget of £11,000) to run the Data Art programme, including 6 Meetups, 6 Workshops and 4 Hackathons, and this budget allocation is directly to fund venue, refreshments, travel and equipment costs.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to participate in the programme or help run the project, join the Meetup Group below or contact dataart@farsetlabs.org.uk for more information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After going through due process, the desk usage policy has been updated to: explicitly state that un-rented desks should be cleared after use; that members have the right to move equipment left on un-rented desks to communal storage areas; which desks are currently rented/hot-desk/communal; and implementing standard COSHH practices.<span id="more-2931"></span></p>
<p>Here at Farset Labs, we started off with a relatively simple, if comprehensive, sets of <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">Rules, Policies, and Codes of Conduct</a>, covering the use of the space, equipment in the space, and the guidelines that we as a community agree to abide to.</p>
<p>99% of these can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the space better than you found it.</li>
<li>Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sometimes it becomes necessary to be a little more explicit about the expectations of the wider community. Two issues that have been raised with the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/">management and director teams</a> occasionally but persistently since day one is &#8220;someone left a desk covered in junk, what do?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this desk rented?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://farsetlabs.slack.com/archives/C03G2CK5J/p1527063330000063">Around May time</a>, discussions in the Slack boiled up to a point where the Directorship and Management teams realised that for about a year we&#8217;d been discussing a &#8220;Clear Desk Policy&#8221; that we were absolutely sure we definitely, definitely, had one that said &#8220;clear up your stuff when your done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oops.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>So, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koEeVoujnw3RIsW0fy_TxjXLvebNwtC0V7OWSbBGKZY/edit#heading=h.ljhyi1zcfx4r">June Town Hall</a>, I raised <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Gbpx3m7K2IdUzjPjvuPLP4QbLGaG3riKGkQPGybypQ/edit#slide=id.p">a proposal</a> to address a few simultaneous issues around &#8216;where should be clear, who should clear it, and where can I put stuff?&#8217;. This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.</p>
<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling. We have since day one had an explicit exclusion on firearms/ammunition , explosives, Offensive weapons, Unlicensed radio equipment, large quantities of combustibles, inflammables, or pressurised gases, stolen equipment, or banned substances. However, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed from the <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/f90919fa0711f5e816a2f2252912d0bbd8ab4860#diff-d39a174faa68201faf0c6caaf6c912ba">old rules</a>, &#8216;large quantities&#8217; was never defined, so naturally we eventually got a couple of reports of members effectively bulk buying both high end solvents and pressurised containers on the cheap, and stashing them in boxes somewhere&#8230; So David Kane and Colin Kelsey took on the task in writing up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8u9mFUWM5no0mWuirTc53Zq5wBjiHrlaIC0Z-wNEOQ/edit">their own proposal</a> to expand and extend the coverage of our COSHH policies, that was similarly unanimously ratified at the June Town Hall.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of behind the scenes process; that doesn&#8217;t mean in &#8216;Farset Land&#8217; that the new rules came in to force; just that the community had agreed in principal to the rough outlines; the proposal still needed to be turned in to the actual changes required in the Rules, Policy&#8217;s and Codes of Conduct to bring them up to speed with the proposal; if it&#8217;s not <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">on the website</a> it&#8217;s not a real rule.</p>
<p>Since moving our website to <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/tree/21817e4c38c251fa5149f7cc8574e0322c8757f0">Github hosted Markdown in 2013</a>, any changes to &#8216;the rules&#8217; have been recorded and mostly Pull-Request/Reviewed as part of the ratification process in order to be as open as possible. We&#8217;re not always perfect at this but we&#8217;re getting better about being as transparent and open as possible and not just rushing through rule changes without consultation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/165">COSHH pull request</a> was relatively simple to review and merge as it was mostly technical and &#8216;edge case&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/164">Desk Rental pull request</a> was a bit more complex, with members of the community collaborating and beating out the policy changes to cover any edge cases, and was signed off on at last nights&#8217; Town Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant&#8221; changes in this policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently-Rented Hot-Desks, are indicated as in red on the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">Facilities page</a>, and it is the responsibility of the Directors and NEMs to keep this up to date.</li>
<li>Any desks labeled in green in the facilities diagram are available for Rental</li>
<li>All Green and Blue desks are subject to a clear desk policy, which means these desks must be cleared of all equipment (on or under) before leaving the space</li>
<li>Any equipment left unattended at such desks can be moved by any member to common storage facilities.</li>
<li>Two desks in the workshop are being opened up to being rented.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to thank the members who made it out last week to blitz and &#8220;defrag&#8221; the whole space; it&#8217;s survived a week without turning back in to a tip which is always a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="VID 20180730 WA0003 2" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQMmesROYK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s a little notification/story from the governance of Farset; as a reminder, Town Halls are held on the first Monday of the month in the Event Space at 7pm and are open to both members and interested-non members (however non-members can&#8217;t vote). A lot of Farsets&#8217; day-to-day governance <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">is handled in our Slack</a>, which, again, is open to both members and non-members.</p>
<p>If there are any questions or ideas about how governance is handled, we&#8217;re more than happy for those to be discussed publicly on Github or Slack, or privately by emailing info@farsetlabs.org.uk, or admin@farsetlabs.org.uk if there is something sensitive to be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Interested in getting hands experiences on with the BBC micro:bit, due to land in the hands of every Year 8 student in the summer term? Now’s your chance!</strong></p>
<p>Farset Labs will be running a free, hands on &#8220;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-bbc-microbit-tickets-22031409539" target="_blank">Getting started with the BBC micro:bit</a>&#8221; Computing at Schools Northern Ireland Hub workshop on the 10th March 2016 from 6:30pm-9:00pm at Farset Labs.<br />
<strong>We will hope to cover</strong><br />
&#8211; What is the micro:bit?<br />
&#8211; Getting started and making your first programs<br />
&#8211; Brief overview of the different programming environments available<br />
&#8211; More in depth look at Python on the micro:bit<br />
&#8211; Ideas for use in the classroom</p>
<p>We will have a few computers available at Farset, but if possible, please bring your own laptop.</p>
<p>If you have any queries or questions, feel free to drop myself (Andrew Mulholland, Outreach Manager @ Farset Labs) an email at andrew.mulholland@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>
<p>This event is supported by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cas_ni" target="_blank">Computing at Schools NI</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Do I need to have any previous programming experience?</strong><br />
Nope! We are targeting the workshop at those will little or no programming experience.</p>
<p><strong>I am not a secondary school level teacher (am a primary school teacher, higher education academic or from industry), can I come down and take part?</strong><br />
Unfortunately we expect high demand for this workshop so have to prioritise secondary teachers for now. If we still have space closer to the workshop, we would still love to see you there though. Put your name down for the waiting list for the &#8220;Other&#8221; ticket type and we will be in contact closer to the date.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demand, we well look into launching follow-on events for a wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to provide my own BBC micro:bit?</strong><br />
Nope! We have been kindly been provided a set by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything then I need to bring?</strong><br />
If you have a laptop running Windows, Mac OS or Linux, then it would be great if you could bring it. Although we have some computers available, it is better to learn and practice on familiar equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there free parking available nearby?</strong><br />
Yip! Weavers Court Business estate (which Farset Labs is located within) has ample onsite free parking.</p>

<p>Fail fast, fail cheap.</p>
<p>Or is it &#8220;fail fast, fail often&#8221;?</p>
<p>On Saturday, 7 Nov we&#8217;re uniting with some of our friends, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/672534676155502/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Design Salon</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thepottingshedbelfast/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Potting Shed</a>, for an all-day event, as part of the first ever <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/" target="_blank">Belfast Design Week</a>. You&#8217;re invited to join us in a creative, hands-on, welcoming environment, as we all take the journey from idea to soup.</p>
<p>Event Summary: Sat 7 Nov 2015 // 10:00 until late (12:30 – 16:00 at Farset) // Register here: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast: Makers&#8217; Day Field Trip to Farset Labs</a> // It&#8217;s all FREE OF CHARGE.</p>
<p>Yes, soup. We will begin the day at The Hive, venture over to Farset in the afternoon, then end up back at The Hive for a pitching session, while we enjoy some hot refreshment with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/belfastsoupni?fref=ts" target="_blank">Belfast Soup</a>. Mmm, soup.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll all go to the pub. Mmm, beer.</p>
<p>That Saturday of Design Week is designated as Makers&#8217; Day so roll up your sleeves and come f*@k things up with us. You don&#8217;t need to consider yourself a designer or maker to get value out of the day. It&#8217;s a good chance to make some smart, creative friends and take part in the fascinating process of developing ideas.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the planned Itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:00 – 12:00: The Potting Shed @The Hive : Bring your new or existing idea to the Potting Shed team and get their multidisciplinary input on how to make it happen or bring it to its full potential.</li>
<li>12.30: Walk from The Hive to Farset Labs.</li>
<li>13:00 – 16:00: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast</a> @ Farset Labs: taking the ideas and designing prototypes to see how they might function in reality.</li>
<li>16:00: Walk back from Farset Labs to The Hive.</li>
<li>17:00 – 19:00: Belfast Soup @ The Hive: Buy some soup and pitch your ideas for the chance to win some startup money to make it happen!</li>
<li>19:00 – Collapse: Drinks at The Sunflower.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/events/2015/11/7/makers-day" target="_blank">here</a> is the official page and links to register for other parts of the day.</p>
<p>For our part, we&#8217;re going to focus on that challenging step in the creative process where you have to get your idea out of your head and into the world so it can be given a chance to fail. During the workshop we&#8217;ll talk about what prototyping involves, and look at the recent revolution in rapid prototyping, assisted by technologies like 3D printers and the internet. Then we&#8217;ll stop talking and play – making simple prototypes with paper and pen and whatever we have to hand.</p>
<p>You can come to all or just part of the day&#8217;s events. Or just meet us in the pub in the evening. Mmm beer. There&#8217;s no charge but please register if you&#8217;re coming so we know the numbers. And we&#8217;re seeking techie, creative and communicative people to be in the room to help facilitate progress – please <a href="mailto:ben.m.bland@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you can help.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re calling it FailFast to resurrect an old project that never got much momentum. I guess you could say it failed, rather fast. But that&#8217;s the whole point. There&#8217;s a popular sentiment in the entrepreneurial world that failure is a big part of innovation and creativity. So much so that it has become trendy. Most ideas don&#8217;t grow into anything substantial. Most startups collapse. The important thing is to try – develop your idea, get your prototype out into the world, see if it works and iterate on its development, and do so as quickly and cheaply as possible. It will probably fail so if you want something to succeed, fail fast, fail cheap and fail often. So yeh, we&#8217;re calling it FailFast.</p>
<p>Oh, and it rhymes with Belfast. Sort of.</p>

<p>Speakers and content are being discussed at the moment but we&#8217;ve plenty lined-up so far, from educational tutorials to a lighter take on the dark side of data. This is a good chance to learn about the big data movement and debate the validity and impact of the trend.</p>
<p>Feel free to jump in on the <a title="Big Data Week on Discourse" href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/big-data-week-at-farset-5th-9th-may/333/7" target="_blank">discussion on our Discourse forum</a> ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Other events are running at different venues between 7 and 9 May, with the main show being the Big Data Insights Conference at <a title="Titanic Belfast" href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/" target="_blank">Titanic Belfast</a> all day on the Wednesday. More at <a title="Big Data Week Belfast" href="http://bigdataweek.com/belfast/" target="_blank">Big Data Week Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>All are welcome but please <a title="Big Data in Little Farset on GetInvited" href="https://getinvited.to/benbland/big-data-in-little-farset/" target="_blank">register FREE here</a> so we know you&#8217;re coming. And watch out for the Giro D&#8217;Italia road closures, including Gt Victoria St, which you can dodge by coming over to Sandy Row. Bloody cyclists, coming here, stealing our congestion!</p>
