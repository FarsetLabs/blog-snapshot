<p>Greetings members&nbsp;and friends!<br />Time to hack together some comfort foods and share them with others!</p>



<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and&nbsp;swapping stories of your 2018.<br />No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come with&nbsp;us&nbsp;so far.<br />There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorative&nbsp;decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />The date for this is Saturday 15th December, from 7pm to 10pm. We can carry on as we see fit!</p>



<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>



<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: Â£3)</p>



<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We will&nbsp;have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them and a little fridge space, however there is obviously very limited space for cooking on-site.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is aÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a>Â focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of theÂ <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a>Â movement. There are already a number of largeÂ <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a>Â involved in this yearâ€™s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Irelandâ€™s only public GGJ site sinceÂ <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teamsâ€™ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game JamÂ <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment â€“ the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />
<i>Please note:Â </i>You must be over 18 on the 26th of January in order to participate.</p>
<p class="p1">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contactÂ <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a>Â or ask us questions viaÂ <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a>Â </span>orÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a>Â with the #farsetggj18 hashtag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good merry-tide once again, membersÂ and friends!<br />
The season of wintry victuals is upon us once more, so start with the heart of all things hacky!</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, andÂ swapping stories of your 2017.<br />
No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come withÂ usÂ so far.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorativeÂ decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: Â£3)</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />
Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We willÂ have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them (the oven has gone to the great white-goods store in the sky&#8230;) however there is obviously limited space for cooking on-site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good merry-tide, members, friends, associates, and lovely patient observers!<br />
The year rushed us into winter with the alacrity of a brusque elderly relation, so it&#8217;s once more time to meet together and eat together!</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and identifying your opposite number. If you don&#8217;t have an opposite number, you can have a go at recruiting one.<br />
No matter your persuasion or affiliation, it&#8217;s an evening of welcome open to all who frequent Farset and have supported us throughout our 2015 adventure.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, and suitably bright decorations&#8230; um&#8230; decorating the place.</p>
<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />
The date for this is Thursday 10th December (at 7pm).</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff (cold/hot, liquid/solid). We had a particularly large selection of pulled pork, desserts and cheeses at last year&#8217;s very popular meet-up, if that gives you any ideas <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. Â (Suggested donation: Â£3)</p>

<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Salutations of the season, no matter your persuasion or affiliation! Dinner is open to all who frequent Farset and have supported us through the dark times and the light.<br />
Bring your preferred shareable food-stuff in a prepared state, to <strong>Farset Labs</strong> at <strong>7pm</strong>. There will be disposable plates, cups and cutlery available for sharing. We will also have two microwaves on hand to re-heat anything hot that you bring with you &#8211; please bring it in a non-metal container if possible.<br />
Please feel free to bring drinks &#8211; there will be the usual array of soft-drinks available.<br />
Add your voice in the <a title="Discourse" href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/farset-ad-hoc-pot-luck-seasonal-dinner-hack-christmas-dinner/656">Discourse</a>, or go to theÂ <a title="Facebook event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/820463601348234/?fref=ts">Facebook event</a>.</p>
<p>There will also be some accompaniments of the musical variety, and suitably bright decorations&#8230; um&#8230; decorating the place.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
There is no cost other than your company and some form of shareable (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
