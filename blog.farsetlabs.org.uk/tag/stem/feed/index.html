										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest project  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>

<p>Farset Labs is playing host to the <a href="http://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.com/">Weavers Court CoderDojo</a>, kicking things off with a &#8216;soft launch&#8217; next Thursday the 21st from 17:30-20:00. With mentors (and kids) hopefully coming from all over the park and from the community of Sandy Row, we think that this will be a great addition to our <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php?title=Outreach_Projects">growing outreach activities</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be running the Dojo on the First and Third Thursday&#8217;s of the month (we know this makes for a strange end-of-May, but it&#8217;s the lesser of two evils&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p>
<p>At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.</p>
<p>CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.</p>
<p>It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don&#8217;t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there an age limit to enter the event?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> is aimed loosely at the under 18&#8217;s, but any child younger than 14 <strong>must</strong> be accompanied by a parent or guardian</p>
<p><strong>What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus</p>
<p><strong>What should I bring to the event?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that&#8217;d be great.</p>
<p><strong>I can&#8217;t make it, what can I do to help?</strong></p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at BMC in <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/110" target="_blank">Belfast</a>, <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/274" target="_blank">Ballymena</a>, or the brand new Dojo in <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/45" target="_blank">Newry</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.</p>

<p>This is going to sound old hat, but here at Farset, we&#8217;re all about cultivating an environment where the next generation of technologists can come into their own, but as the old saying goes, to teach is to learn twice.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we are always encouraging not only peer-teaching within the space and at Farset events, but also try and encourage our members to take part in STEM outreach to local schools.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;ve been internally working on a <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">semi-regularly-updated wiki of the STEM events that need help in Northern Ireland</a>, and hopefully, people will step up to the plate and give their time and energy to the next generation of technologists.</p>
<p>And before you say &#8220;That&#8217;s the teachers job&#8221;, just think back to your own teachers. Did they really know about the latest and greatest technologies going on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your IT teacher show you how to deploy RoR services on <a href="http://www.golygon.com/2010/11/tutorial-ruby-on-rails-hosted-on-amazon-cloud/" target="_blank">cloud based LAMP stacks</a>?</li>
<li>Did your technology teacher show you how to put an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Preliminary-SPI-on-the-Pi-Communicating-with-a-/" target="_blank">accelerometer and GPS on a Raspberry Pi </a>to act as a vehicle data logger?</li>
<li>Did your Geography teacher show you have to use GOV.UK open data resources to <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/buses/realtime.htm" target="_blank">map GIS data in real-time</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet they didn&#8217;t (obviously replace those with temporally relevant technologies&#8230;).</p>
<p>As an aside, we&#8217;re trying to find someone to fund travel expenses for such outreach, because we definitely can&#8217;t! But if you&#8217;re free at any of the listed times, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us or the listed contact points on the wiki and give back to the education system.</p>
<h1><a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">GO HERE AND PLEASE GIVE YOUR TIME</a></h1>
