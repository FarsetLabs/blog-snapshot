										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Department of Communities &#8220;Creativity Month 2018&#8221;, Farset are coordinating two workshop-style events this year, continuing our now 5 year track record of delivering awesome weirdness! Bog Standard and IdeaJam, both kindly supported by the <a href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/">Department of Communities NI</a></p>
<h1><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ideajam-tickets-44071792919">IdeaJam</a></h1>
<p><strong>Ideas. We’ve all got ‘em, rattling around in our busy, distracted heads.</strong></p>
<p>On <em>Saturday 31st March, 10am &#8211; 10pm</em>, Farset Labs will host <strong>IDEA JAM</strong> – a chance for creators, designers and developers to clear all distractions and finally sculpt that secret, nebulous idea you’ve been chipping away at for years into that&#8217;s ready to pitch and take it to the next level.</p>
<p>You might be harbouring a business, a novel, a video game, a TV pilot, a children’s book or a screenplay… it’s there, hiding behind grocery lists, bank statements and status updates.</p>
<p>It’s time to finally get that idea out of your head and into the world, so you can actually do something real with it.</p>
<p>Artists, developers and other screen industry experts will be on hand to help transfer your concept from brain to pitch, whether it’s a story arc, synopsis, sketch or sizzle reel&#8230; and maybe even tell you where to take it next.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>The schedule is pretty informal, as this is <strong>your</strong> time for <strong>your </strong>idea. Meals will be catered through the day, starting with breakfast at<strong> 9:30am</strong>. Industry mentors with experience of pitching business, film and game concepts will be available from <strong>10:00am</strong> to guide you in fleshing out your idea into something that you can pitch and develop.</p>
<p>By <strong>10:00pm</strong> your goal is to have your concept realised, and even ready to pitch to others!</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bog-standard-tickets-43925335862">Bog Standard &#8211; Rethinking the Humble Bathroom</a></h1>
<p><em>Thus 22nd March, 5:30pm &#8211; 10pm</em></p>
<p>How would you build a better bog? What factors go into improving a service or product?</p>
<p>Design thinking is a buzz phrase that is often thrown around, but what does it really mean? This evening workshop applies design thinking concepts in a concrete manner; exploring the design considerations of the humble bathroom.</p>
<p>Through iterative explorations facilitated by experienced Design Thinking Practitioners, and the use of empathy generating techniques and ideation tools; a mix of attendees from all backgrounds will be encouraged to explore the impact of changing societal, technical and practical needs in a familiar context, all while additional &#8220;Chaos Factors&#8221; are added over the course of the evening to keep things interesting!</p>
