<p>In the face of  &#8216;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/unprecedented-times/" target="_blank">unprecedented times</a>&#8216;, while the space, events facilities, co-working facilities and new-and-improved workshop (and Laser Cutter&#8230;) are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/coronavirus" target="_blank">still available to socially-distanced members</a>, this year we can&#8217;t offer the usual warm, pizza and burrito fueled welcome we have over nearly the past decade to Northern Ireland&#8217;s Games Development community. </p>

<p>So, we have teamed up with our friends at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nigame.dev/" target="_blank">NI Game Dev Network</a> to coordinate the Northern Ireland <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">site </a>of GGJ online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with a live-streamed kickoff event at 7pm on Friday 29th January, the jam will run from until Sunday 31st January, and is a brilliant chance to virtually meet and collaborate with people from the local games industry while making interesting games and experiences in a weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is <strong>no </strong>required skill level to take part &#8211; programmers, artists, musicians and enthusiasts are all welcome.</p>



<p>Global Game Jam is a worldwide weekend focused on creating games; from fully interactive video-games, to board games and card games. Some of the games are created for charitable causes, such as “Games For Change”. The global event involves a number of large industry sponsors, including PayPal, Unity, Sony Interactive, Microsoft, and it often acts as a stepping stone for new games developers.</p>

<p> The theme will be announced on Wednesday 27 January, and previous years have seen amateurs and professionals from all over Northern Ireland come to create thought-provoking projects, and have fun while doing it.</p>



<p>The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world for 2019. </p>



<p>Farset Labs and the NIGDN will be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/farsetlabs" target="_blank">broadcasting live</a> from our Belfast facility throughout the 48hour event (with over-night special guests to burn the midnight oil!), as well as sharing feeds from Jam sites world-wide.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />
<i>Please note: </i>You must be over 18 on the 26th of January in order to participate.</p>
<p class="p1">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a> or ask us questions via <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a> </span>or <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a> with the #farsetggj18 hashtag.</p>

<p><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Farset Labs is back again in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The Game Jam will run <strong>from </strong></span><strong>Friday 29th to Sunday 31st January</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and is a chance to meet some great people and develop a fun game in a weekend.  With a party atmosphere from Friday night, there will be plenty of people there to team up with, create something interesting and, most importantly, to have fun!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s jam was a great success, with our highest jammer count yet!</span><span id="more-2673"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Update: The Night Before Game-Jam<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">We&#8217;ll be kicking off <strong>GGJ Belfast</strong> in just over 24hrs folks! The official kick-off, introduction and keynote will begin at <strong>5pm on Friday</strong>. We&#8217;ll be open a couple of hours before that, so everyone is welcome to come down early to set up and socialise with your fellow jammers!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">So everyone can get into making their games straight away, we also recommend that you download any software you might find useful <strong>before</strong> getting to Farset Labs (or make sure you have the latest updates) particularly if you&#8217;re planning to use packages like Photoshop, Unity or similar software. There&#8217;s a list of resources here: <a style="color: #008000;" href="http://globalgamejam.org/jammer-resources" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://globalgamejam.org/jammer-resources</a> including some useful tips and a few free bonuses for jammers taking part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Jams are often oversubscribed; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is free, and all meals are catered!  The game jam’s theme will be announced at </span><b>5pm on Friday 29th January</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Global Game Jam?<br />
</strong>Global Game Jam is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games For Change</a> movement.  There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors">sponsors</a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 480 individual Jam sites registered around the world. We will be live streaming video from sites all over during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/farset-labs">listing</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">After a very successful event last year, Farset Labs has decided to take part for a second year in <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam will run from Friday 24th to Sunday 26th January, and is a chance to meet some great people and develop a fun game with a theme. The theme will be announced on the night, and there will be plenty of people there to team up with to create something interesting and, most importantly, to have fun!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Global Game Jam is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts,from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games.

<p dir="ltr">The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009, and this year there are already over 350 individual Jam sites registered around the world. We will be live streaming video from sites all over during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see (and perhaps play) other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue, for anyone not familiar, can be found on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/jam-sites/farset-labs">listing</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry, we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! For anyone interested, this year you can list your skills ahead of the event <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhNxF3GWLga_dHJXLW43S1QwcDdYa1phWi1JVjFjUEE&amp;usp=sharing">here</a> and see what other skills and abilities participants will have. The organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams, and we have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entry to the event is free, though it is asked that you register on the Global Game Jam site if you are participating. We also have an Eventbrite listing for the event to allow people to register and give us an idea of numbers. The theme will be announced at 5pm on the Friday so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time. Looking forward to seeing you all for this, it should be a great weekend!</p>

<p dir="ltr">PS We are looking for corporate sponsorship for this event to cover venue and refreshments costs, but the event will go on regardless. If you&#8217;d be interested in helping us out, <a href="mailto:ggj@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another first for the local tech community: Farset Labs is proud to announce becoming Belfast&#8217;s first and only official site for <a title="Global Game Jam – World's largest game jam event" href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>, set this year for 25-27 January. This is the biggest event of its kind in the world and brings some big name sponsors like <a title="Microsoft" href="www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a title="Facebook" href="facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a title="GitHub – Social Coding." href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Farset will be open for the full 48-hour period, as each participant team competes to build a game in a weekend. The event is being hosted in conjunction with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster Office of Innovation</a>, who will be providing refreshments so <strong>entry will be free</strong>. Belfast&#8217;s hackerspace is calling out to all kinds of creative and technical people to take part, as game development brings together the likes of writers, artists, coders, character designers, production managers and many more roles.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 342px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org"><img decoding="async" class="  " alt="Global Game Jam" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gobal-Game-Jam-logo.jpg" width="342" height="224" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Global Game Jam</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Global Game Jam is essentially a <a title="Hackathon – Wikipedia definition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts,</strong> from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a title="Games for Change – Game development for social change." href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank">Games For Change</a> movement.  We expect some exciting announcements on the day from the sponsors and organisers as to what data and platforms they&#8217;re going to let us play with, and we have plans to put some mileage on <a title="Successful crowdfunding of our new 3D printer" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/you-did-it-our-3d-printer-is-in-the-post/" target="_blank">our new 3D printer</a>.</p>
<p>The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009. Last January, 242 locations in 47 countries created over 2,000 games in one weekend to become a <a title="Global Game Jam Guinness World Record" href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/2012/03/01/global-game-jam-sets-guinness-world-record%E2%84%A2-being-largest-game-jam-world" target="_blank">Guinness World Record</a>. But sites for this year&#8217;s event have already been registered in around 300 locations in over 60 countries, so your involvement will be part of a new world record. Farset&#8217;s Andrew Bolster is the official organiser for the event in Belfast and has been collaborating with other organisations to make it a special occasion.</p>
<p>As part of the Jam, participants (or &#8216;Jammers&#8217;) will have access to a range of materials provided by corporate sponsors. The details are on the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/promotions">GGJ</a> page, but there are a few that deserve highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$100 credit</strong> on the <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> high performance cloud, a perfect place to host your online games,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coronalabs.com/">Corona Labs</a> are giving away 3 months of it&#8217;s full <strong>Indie SDK</strong>, perfect for building and hosting mobile games and social applications,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mixamo.com/">Mixamo</a>, the film-grade character animation suite with simple import and export to a range of applications including <strong>Blendr</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>, are opening up loads of toolkits for Jammers,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/">YoYo Games</a> are also giving away licenses to their<strong> GameMaker:Studio</strong> software for developing cross-platform mobile games, and finally</li>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, the heart and soul of so many developers, are giving<strong> $70 credit</strong> to each location, and we&#8217;ll be putting it up as a &#8216;Peoples Choice&#8217; prize on Sunday Evening</li>
</ul>
<p>A few key considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t need any specific skills to participate, although having a coder in your team may prove useful.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need a team. In fact, the organisers discourage the formation of teams in advance, and suggest working that out at the time.</li>
<li>A <strong>secret theme</strong> will be announced at the start, by which all the games will be influenced.</li>
<li>Kick-off will be at 17:00 on 25 January. There will be video presentations from some big industry players to get everyone going.</li>
</ul>
<p>So&#8230; maybe you&#8217;ll head down to Farset Labs to play your hand in a world event that is set to be a real game-changer.</p>
