What we&#8217;re seeing however are some pretty big-ticket items, which is great, but we also need the small stuff. Grouped together, the items that are listed below are pretty costly, but individually, they&#8217;re very cheap. Donating something from this list is a great way to get involved if you can&#8217;t afford to donate something bigger.<span id="more-143"></span> So, without further ado, here are a list of essential, but not immediately obvious items that we need as a matter of urgency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mugs and glasses (the plainer the better and matching stuff would be awesome, but we&#8217;ll take what we get as long as it isn&#8217;t damaged)</li>
<li>Plates and bowls (as above)</li>
<li>Cutlery</li>
<li>Cleaning products (Fairy, bleach, Dettol, cloths)</li>
<li>Clean plastic sheeting (for any painting and for workshop use later)</li>
<li>Bins (both for paper/office stuff and a kitchen bin)</li>
<li>Handwash (not bars of soap)</li>
<li>Decent power strips (preferably with individual on/off switches and anti-surge)</li>
<li>Desk lamps</li>
<li>Hand tools</li>
</ul>
<div>Items on the list will get crossed out as we get enough of them in, so that we don&#8217;t have storage issues. Thanks in advance!</div>
<p>Please use the donation form below if you&#8217;re willing to donate: (some browsers have trouble with it so here&#8217;s an alternative:Â <a title="The Great Farset Labs Donation Form" href="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDJRanJpZTlPTW9VN3VLbWtWRllibGc6MQ" target="_blank">link</a>.)</p>
