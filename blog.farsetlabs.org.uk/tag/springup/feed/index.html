										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SpringUp_Team21.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-346 alignleft" title="SpringUp_Team2" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SpringUp_Team2-200x3001.jpg" alt="Still a long way to go on the chalk progress bar just after the start of SpringUp – our 28-hour non-stop startup challenge" width="200" height="300" /></a>Hopefully it&#8217;s not big-headed to say that we&#8217;re chuffed with the outcome of our very first open event last weekend. One of our founding members Matt Campbell brought in a 28-hour non-stop startup hackathon called <a href="http://springup.co/">SpringUp</a> and, to put it simply, five new web businesses were launched overnight. It&#8217;s nice when you say it like that.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the competition winners, Alrg, who have created an online recommendation service that lists eateries for people with special dietary needs. They rocked the judges with not only a nicely made site, but also some kick-ass market stats and potential revenue streams. It sounds niche but, in short, WAY more people have food allergies than you think.</p>
<p><span id="more-342"></span></p>
<p>But judgement was tough. Although there were only five teams, the quality of projects was humbling. Online arbitrage, car sales, personal finance support, and an app management tool, all built by teams of two to five people in one sitting. Well almost one sitting. Everyone bailed for brief sleep eventually, except one – massive props to Arie for coding all night. I think we can ignore his ten-minute power snooze on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>We had no idea if the event was going to come together, and at times it felt like it really wouldn&#8217;t. But some of our industry friends stepped up and recovered our faith that the tech community is a supportive place to be. Our neighbours at <a href="http://www.anaeko.com/">Anaeko</a> bought enough sandwiches and burritos to sink an aircraft carrier – oh yes, <a href="http://www.boojummex.com/">Boojum</a> said it was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/boojum_belfast/status/194703225130201088">one of their biggest orders</a>, a true cause for pride. <a href="http://rumblelabs.com/">Rumble Labs</a> dropped the grand prize of 500 filthy quids. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> gave out subscription credits, and we put up some free memberships of our humble abode.</p>
<p>A few personal take-outs from our long, hard, geek-gang-bang&#8230; Anaeko&#8217;s CTO Colm Hayden, in a troop-rousing talk, told the teams that these are &#8220;boom times&#8221;, and while some people want job stability and a narrow career route, we will never be like them. He also promoted new development models, saying it&#8217;s &#8220;lean all the way&#8221;. Quite.</p>
<p>Simon Hamilton (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hamstarr/">@hamstarr</a>), chief of Rumble Labs, got down to the dirty details of working methodology, discouraging small talk and pushing for more productivity. He promoted wireframes and paper-prototypes for efficiency, and added the classic advice of &#8220;don&#8217;t open any Adobe products&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was interested to see that what I thought were the strongest pitches got the biggest hammering from the judges, who were there to assume the role of potential investors. It then transpired that those teams scored highest. I guess the judges were biting on what they saw as a good thing. If they had stayed quiet, it would have been a troubling sign for the pitching team.</p>
<p>So what would we do differently next time? Well the biggest criticism was from a couple of the developers, who felt that their efforts went unrecognised because the event was focused on making an investment pitch, not presenting the tech work. They worked like troopers all weekend and deserved more credit.</p>
<p>&#8230;and will there be a next time? Oh yes. Even just after the two-day slog of SpringUp, people were keen for more of the same. So we will be hosting the provisionally entitled FlackNight, for 24 hours starting at 16:00 on Saturday 19th May. It&#8217;ll be a pared-down process with a more tech and code focus. No sponsors, no prizes, just the reward of peer-critique from likeminded people. Oh, and the Craic, of course.</p>
<p>More on FlackNight coming soon&#8230;</p>

<p>Things move quickly here at Farset Towers <a title="For those of you younger than 20" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace#.5EH" target="_blank">^H^H^H^H^H</a> Labs.</p>
<p>Twenty four hours ago, we had nothing special happening soon and no real &#8216;pattern&#8217; of events. We hadn&#8217;t made any real changes to the space other than the brilliant work that the <a title="Weavers Court, our fantastic landlords" href="http://www.weaverscourt.com" target="_blank">Weavers Court</a> contractors have done to get the space up to spec.</p>
<p>First big change was the news that <a title="Spring Up" href="http://www.springup.co/" target="_blank">SpringUp</a>, an innovative incubation event similar to <a title="Y-Combinator" href="http://www.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Y-combinator</a> on speed, had lost its previous venue. In the spirit of community (and PR) we&#8217;ve opened up our event space to them (in addition to our existing prize sponsorship of six months membership for the winning team), but as you can see below, the main presentation wall wasn&#8217;t exactly in the best condition to present on. But that idea was left on the back burner for a while.</p>
<figure id="attachment_273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-273" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-06-03-2012-14-56-571.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-273" title="Before" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-06-03-2012-14-56-57-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-273" class="wp-caption-text">Before (judge for yourselves)</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the inital chat confirming Farset Labs as the SpringUp venue, we received confirmation of hosting this months <a title="#Bloc54" href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/bloc54-games-network-april-meetup" target="_blank">#BLOC54 Games Development Network Meeting</a>. Later we got word of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Belfast-GB/680932/" target="_blank">2nd Global StackOverflow Meetup Day</a>, and after a short discussion, decided to host the previously homeless Belfast chapter</p>
<p>Back to the Black, after a short discussion, a few Facebook and Twitter posts, and a quick trip to <a title="Homebase" href="http://www.homebase.co.uk" target="_blank">Homebase</a>, and we started painting the back wall of the eventspace with blackboard paint (we&#8217;ve got tonnes left by the way!). This process (over 30 square metres of space that is!) took approximately an hour, and was touch-dry within another hour, ready for a few touch-ups. Then we settled into a mini-<a title="firefly, just watch it." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Firefly</a> marathon accompanied by some pizza and beer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-274" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_20120417_1247271.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-274 " title="After" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_20120417_124727-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-274" class="wp-caption-text">After the Blackening</figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from the painting. Matt Keenan has agreed to take lead on the redevelopment of our internal management system, working with Daniel Reid, Matt Campbell, and a few other nefarious characters. I&#8217;ve been working on my current long-standing obsession that is the &#8216;<a title="Its Big and Red and Button-like" href="http://www.andrewbolster.info/blog/2012/04/k8055-usb-python-twitter-irc-space-indicator-as-a-os-service/" target="_blank">Big Red Button</a>&#8216;, that little piece of code that currently announces to twitter/IRC that the space is open or closed. I&#8217;m building up a Python based server for the <a href="https://hackerspaces.nl/spaceapi/" target="_blank">SpaceAPI</a> to fully expose the activities of Farset Labs in a standard format. Fun stuff.</p>
<p>Eoghan Murray is ploughing on with the redevelopment of the lounge (pending some technical issues with projectors), and Daniel Reid has been working on the icecast-based entertainment server. Feel free to come down and check these and more projects out!</p>
<p>All work and no play makes Bolster something something.</p>
