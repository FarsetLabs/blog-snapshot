										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Conor Robinson for Space-Stuff (<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs/posts/1145573468796794">quite literally</a>) and Pip Shea to her great adventures down under, it&#8217;s time to launch our 2016 Director Elections. Nominations for the two soon-to-be-vacant Directors chairs will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday 2nd September</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nominate themselves.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their name.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Monday 5th September</strong> (Conveniently coinciding with the next Town Hall) and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 30th September</strong>.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In the event that there are less than 4 nominees, only one Director seat will be voted on and nominations will be reopened later this year.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/director-elections/" target="_blank">elections</a>, available on this blog.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Good luck!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help us understand the needs of our member base, and to point us toward the areas we need to improve upon, we&#8217;ve come up with a short member survey for the New Year. This contains questions regarding each of our management areas, and should help us to improve Farset Labs to better serve you.</p>
<p>The survey is open to all members, regardless of membership duration or level. (Management included!)</p>
<p>All active members have been emailed with this survey, and so far roughly 50% have responded. It&#8217;s quite possible that some of the email addresses we&#8217;ve used are old and inactive, however. <strong>If you&#8217;re a current member and haven&#8217;t already received a link to our survey, please email us (admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) and let us know!</strong></p>
<p>The survey will close at <strong>Midnight on Tuesday 19th January</strong>. Once the survey closes, the results will be published, along with our plans!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a closely fought race between <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/election-2015-ballot/">Pip and Ron</a> but in the end, the community rallied behind Pip to help bring her vision to the leadership at Farset Labs.</p>
<p>When I hassled her for comment, this is what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheers to all who got involved in the recent election. I&#8217;m delighted to have been voted in, and am looking forward to getting my hands dirty to help keep Farset an excellent place.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can check out what Pip&#8217;s all about on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/" target="_blank">her website</a>.</p>
<p>PS The entire Farset Labs community would also like to congratulate Pip and her partner on their recently completed adoption, there are no two better people for it, and we wish you and your new family all the best!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/director-vote-2015/823">Voting is now open</a>; if you haven&#8217;t recieved an email and think you should have, or can&#8217;t access the poll, contact membership@farsetlabs.org.uk to double check your membership status.</strong></p>
<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pip Shea</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2613 size-medium" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg" alt="pip_s" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Farset Labs is extra_ordinary. It breaks the mould and defies the &#8216;wisdom&#8217; of incumbent structures through community building and collaboration. It offers an alternative for those of us who lurk in various guises on the creative technology spectrum: a place where we can practice, with autonomy, among an inspired and diverse community. I would like to become a director to help sustain this special space, and to contribute to its emergent practices and identity.</p>
<p>I have been a member since early 2014, and for the last couple of years I have been researching hacker/maker culture. I have a good understanding of the practices of Farset and how it is situated in a broader global context.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to offer my energy to the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>technology education and kids</li>
<li>measuring social impact</li>
<li>funding for social technology projects</li>
<li>participatory governance and ethics</li>
<li>membership drives</li>
<li>sharing Farset’s stories (its projects and practices) with the wider world</li>
<li>getting a laser cutter!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to become more involved in Farset Labs as I am passionate about grassroots making. During the 2000s &#8211; in Australia &#8211; I worked in <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/community-development/">community development</a> as an artist, producer, and manager on projects that focused on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/networked/">net art</a>, aerosol art, and large-scale outdoor <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/projection/">projections</a>. In 2010, I turned my hand to research to investigate <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133">ethical internet practices in the community arts field</a>. I then worked as a research assistant at various universities in various incarnations. My research broadly explores digital cultures and philosophies of technology. I’m currently writing <a href="https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/PipShea">two book chapters</a> about maker culture, and assembling a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/crafting_making_hacking_research">hacking/making/crafting bibliography</a> on Zotero.</p>
<p>Other projects on the boil include: designing interactive tools with the QUB School of Psychology; editing an open access journal; and, making an art project that explores block chains and distributed databases through geometry. Ongoing interests include: <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Appropriate_technology">appropriate technology</a>, <a href="http://conceptlab.com/criticalmaking">critical making</a>, and <a href="http://www.foodphreaking.com/issue0pdf/Food_Phreaking.pdf">food phreaking</a>.</p>
<p>If you feel you need a little more info about me, it can be found at <a href="http://www.pipshea.net">pipshea.net</a></p>
<p>Cheers!</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. RON</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1825" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large-300x1981.jpg" alt="chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>ReOpen Nominations</p>
<p>Ron does nothing, and means we open up nominations again.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Directors assert that this election, odd as it is, satisfy the Director Appointment Rules as set up in the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/c5abb01213e2b017e1dd606e0b6f2c99de567994">ratified</a> by Town Hall Consent from March 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Monday March 25th @ 1900 in the Event Space</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time again, where democracy (otherwise known as &#8220;He who shows up, wins&#8221;) reigns supreme.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be doing the usual financial reporting, strategic reporting, etc, but this time round, we really want to encourage the membership to raise any issues they&#8217;re having with the space, the community, or the organisation in general.</p>
<p>For mundane things that you&#8217;re not worried about people talking about, simply add them to the &#8220;Members items to be raised&#8221; section on the relevant <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Town_Hall/1303">wiki page</a> (or discuss existing items on that pages <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php?title=Talk:Town_Hall/1303&amp;action=edit" target="_blank">Talk page</a>)</p>
<p>Alternatively, if there&#8217;s something private you&#8217;d like to discuss with the directors, either contact them generally on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk, or individually on bolster@farsetlabs.org.uk, eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk or david@farsetlabs.org.uk.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is anything you&#8217;d like to raise anonymously, we&#8217;ve set up the below form to submit your issues.</p>
<p>Farset Labs is what you make of it and we aren&#8217;t psychic; we can&#8217;t do it without you&#8217;re support, guidance, and ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve added a few events to our calendar, accessible <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/community/events/">here</a>, so, in case you&#8217;ve missed any, we&#8217;ve got a round-up of the coming week&#8217;s festivities.</p>
<p>First up, we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/FEAST/FAMINE">FEAST/FAMINE</a> on Sunday night, kicking off at 7pm. The usual, relaxed format applies, so come down, grab a takeaway and end the week in cinematic style. Since this is our informal community movie night, it&#8217;s only open to Farset <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">members</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, we have the <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a> user group in our regular <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Wildcard_User_Group">slot</a>, so, starting from 6:30pm, the Event Space will be filled with odd sounds from our resident <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/belfastcollider">experimental musicians</a>.</p>
<p>We have another Town Hall event scheduled for Saturday at 3pm, allowing members to talk to the Directors and bring up their suggestions or complaints, in personal or <a href="http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/">anonymous</a> form. The Directors will also be bringing up some important discussions and setting out the roadmap for the next few months. Farset Labs members have voting rights, so make sure to come and make your voice heard &#8211; remember, the hackerspace is run for <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>Either side of the Town Hall meeting on Saturday, we&#8217;ll be doing a spring clean, starting at around 10am. We&#8217;d <em>really</em> appreciate a hand with this, so any warm bodies would be very welcome to assist in the cleaning. We&#8217;re aiming to get the entire place spruced up, but we&#8217;re intending to pay special attention to the Workshop, making it easier to use and streamlining the Store.</p>
<p>And, of course, we have our <a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com/#">Raspberry Jam</a> event tomorrow, starting at 1pm, so we&#8217;ll see a lot of you there!</p>
<p>Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>
