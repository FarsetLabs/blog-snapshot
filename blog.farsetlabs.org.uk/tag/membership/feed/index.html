										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Conor Robinson for Space-Stuff (<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs/posts/1145573468796794">quite literally</a>) and Pip Shea to her great adventures down under, it&#8217;s time to launch our 2016 Director Elections. Nominations for the two soon-to-be-vacant Directors chairs will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday 2nd September</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nominate themselves.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their name.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Monday 5th September</strong> (Conveniently coinciding with the next Town Hall) and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 30th September</strong>.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In the event that there are less than 4 nominees, only one Director seat will be voted on and nominations will be reopened later this year.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/director-elections/" target="_blank">elections</a>, available on this blog.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Good luck!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help us understand the needs of our member base, and to point us toward the areas we need to improve upon, we&#8217;ve come up with a short member survey for the New Year. This contains questions regarding each of our management areas, and should help us to improve Farset Labs to better serve you.</p>
<p>The survey is open to all members, regardless of membership duration or level. (Management included!)</p>
<p>All active members have been emailed with this survey, and so far roughly 50% have responded. It&#8217;s quite possible that some of the email addresses we&#8217;ve used are old and inactive, however. <strong>If you&#8217;re a current member and haven&#8217;t already received a link to our survey, please email us (admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) and let us know!</strong></p>
<p>The survey will close at <strong>Midnight on Tuesday 19th January</strong>. Once the survey closes, the results will be published, along with our plans!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1502" alt="Intel &amp; Farset Logos" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos-300x1281.png" width="300" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to publicly announcee our new corporate member&#8230; [drum roll]&#8230; <a href="http://intel.ie">Intel</a>. Welcome to the family!</p>
<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world’s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.</p>
<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel’s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.</p>
<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said “Intel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.”</p>
<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company’s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014. Any suggestions would be very welcome – what would you like to do with Intel?</p>
<p><em>This and the launch of <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">GGJ14</a> are part of this months <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Farset_Jan_News_Pack.zip" target="_blank">Press Pack</a></em></p>

<li><a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> event on the 29th Nov, BYO-Pi</li>
<li>My appearance on the <a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/2012/11/tech-show-podcast-episode-26/" target="_blank">NI Tech Show Podcast</a> with <a href="http://ichristaylor.com/" target="_blank">Chris Taylor</a> and <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/" target="_blank">Matt Johnson<span id="more-720"></span></a></li>
</ul>
<h1>3D Printer Updates</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image91.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-725" title="image9" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image9-300x3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>We&#8217;re all amazed and humbled by the support being given to the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer" target="_blank">3D printing Fundraiser</a>. We&#8217;re proud to be the first &#8216;Technology&#8217; entry on Sponsume, and we&#8217;re so very nearly there you can almost taste it.</p>
<p>In terms of some of the awesome ways people are planning to use the printer, some have really stuck in my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatrical set design models for lightning tests,</li>
<li>Architectural prototyping,</li>
<li>Customised Bow Riser (Handles) for Archers</li>
<li>CCTV Camera Camouflage</li>
<li>3D Printed 3D Scanner (3D-Ception&#8230;?)</li>
</ul>
<div>And it goes without saying that the mad group that is &#8216;our community&#8217; are going to come up with more crazy and strange ways to experiment with the new hardware.</div>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching Farset from the outside, now is a brilliant time to get involved; the top two tiers of donation include a year&#8217;s Enthusiast and Freelance membership respectively.</p>
<p>With 8 days to go and just under £300 to find, if you haven&#8217;t already, please consider making a donation, and you&#8217;ll get <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/reward/2924" target="_blank">cool stuff</a> in return.</p>
<h1>Town Hall</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-503767/Big-Brother-Britain-How-earn-Are-gay-Town-Hall-chiefs-ordered-out.html"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-724" title="townhallDM2012_468x351" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/townhallDM2012_468x351-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Last <a title="Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/" target="_blank">Town Hall meeting</a> was in late September, and it&#8217;s high time, given the changes ad improvements in the space since then, that we all had a face to face chat.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;re going to have a Town Hall meeting booked this coming Friday between 5:30 and 7:00. It&#8217;s hopefully not going to take that long to sort everything out.</p>
<p>On the agenda at the minute (if you want to add anything, let us know in one of the many ways):</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Update</li>
<li>3D Printer Update / Purchasing / Consumable Selection (i.e., if you want to pick the colours of the 3D printer, come to this meeting!)</li>
<li>Potential Project Funding ideas</li>
<li>Equipment rollout (Workshop)</li>
<li>Establishment of Training for members in how to use the space / Health and Safety</li>
<li>AOB (All other business / opportunity to rant)</li>
</ul>
<h1> Flack-Lite?</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-723" title="spamlite" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png" alt="" width="228" height="234" /></a>Since this holiday season is a bit heavy on the tech-events, such as the brilliant  <a href="http://2012.buildconf.com/" target="_blank">Buildconf</a> this week (Good Luck <a href="https://twitter.com/andymcmillan" target="_blank">Andy</a>!), Kainos&#8217; <a href="http://www.healthhackni.com/home.html" target="_blank">HealthHackNI</a> in the city hall in early December, and the wealth of &#8216;Office Nights Out&#8217;, we decided that there&#8217;s little point in scraping together another Full Blown Flacknite before &#8217;13.</p>
<p>So instead, we&#8217;re going to have a casual, BYOPizza <strong>Flack-Lite</strong> weekend, where the space will be open to all, and the theme will be improving Farset Labs&#8217; infrastructure.</p>
<p>Current projects in the todo list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Membership Management</li>
<li>Redo Website</li>
<li>Improve door control (and possibly a proper app!)</li>
<li>Improve FarBot to be smarter</li>
<li>Exposing *something* from the CCTV system to the membership</li>
<li>Building Time-Lapse table for the 3D Printer</li>
</ul>
<div>And More I&#8217;m sure will come to us.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There will be the usual selection of muchies and drinks, but these will be paid for from the community fund, so please, either BYO or make a representative donation.</div>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll have a great deal of awesome projects to show  next week, or at least will have moved along some of our more stubborn issues.</p>
<h1>User Groups</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-722" title="icon.supercollider" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif" alt="" width="62" height="63" /></a>We currently have a full roster of User Groups this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>14th: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> (Algorithmic Music Generation)</li>
<li>21st: <a href="http://belfastjs.org/" target="_blank">BelfastJS</a> (JavaScript, currently with Arduino and Cars)</li>
<li>28th: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/belfastlinux" target="_blank">BLUG</a> (Everything Linux and Open Source)</li>
<li>5th: <a href="https://twitter.com/PyBelfast" target="_blank">PyBelfast</a> (Python, possibly something Raspberry Related, see below)</li>
</ul>
<div>Since we&#8217;re now technically &#8216;At Capacity&#8217;, if any other user groups want to run, we&#8217;ll shuffle things around to try and be fair to everyone, and this will be on a case by case basis.</div>
<h1>Raspberry Jam</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-721" title="cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.16" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png" alt="" width="800" height="116" /></a><a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">On Thursday the 29th, we&#8217;re hosting a Raspberry Jam.</a></p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their <strong>Raspberry Pi to good use</strong>. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This will be Farset Labs&#8217; first Raspberry Pi centred event, and if successful, will be built into the event calendar.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a<strong> Farset Labs Members event,</strong> so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"><strong>This event is in high demand so please book ahead of time to avoid disappointment</strong></a></div>
<h1>And Finally: NI Tech Show</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-726" title="the-tech-show-art" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png" alt="" width="142" height="142" /></a>Light one to finish things off.</p>
<p>I was invited onto the #<a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/category/tech/the-tech-show/" target="_blank">NITechShow</a> podcast last week leading to one of the <a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/2012/11/tech-show-podcast-episode-26/" target="_blank">longest editions</a> that Chris or Matt have done recently (sorry guys) covering a fair amount of the local and global tech news, including the Good the Bad and the Ugly of Microsoft software and hardware (specifically my clicky keyboard), Geeky Christmas gifts for kids (and big kids), a load of events coming up in the NI area, and a big &#8216;ol rant from me about Farset Labs right at the end.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.</p>
<p>Since <em>before</em> day one, a 3D printer has been on the minds of the community (and plenty of people who have said that they would join the community if those facilities were available), and now, <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">we&#8217;re ready to rock</a>!<span id="more-698"></span></p>
<h1>&#8220;Hold on, what are you getting?&#8221;</h1>
<p>What we&#8217;re asking for is £2,000 for an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/ultimaker-kits.html">Ultimaker 3D Printer</a>, an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html">UltiController</a> (allowing members to print their plans directly from SD card), and several kilos of <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">ABS and PLA Plastic</a> to actually print, along with a rolling tool-table to keep all of the relevant parts in one &#8216;package&#8217; for easy use.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://blog.ultimaker.com/about/">Dutch</a> designed and manufactured kits can deposit 3mm diameter ABS or PLA plastic to an accuracy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0125+mm">12.5 micrometres</a>, in a potential build volume of over <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21x21x22+cm">2.5 gallons</a>, at a rate of a cubic centimetre every 7 seconds, at a rough cost of 4p/cm$^3$.</p>
<h1>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it just be bought outright?&#8221;</h1>
<p>Farset Labs serves a wide community with very disparate interests, from PS2 Clustering to Pinball repair. As such, it isn&#8217;t fair for the collective community to pay so much for one sector, especially if the interest in that sector is speculative. Beyond that argument, Farset Labs operates on a break-even basis at the minute and as such, simply can&#8217;t afford such a large investment at this time.</p>
<h1>&#8220;So what do I get for my hard earned donation?&#8221;</h1>
<p>There are nine donation reward levels, ranging from &#8216;Just feeling good about yourself&#8217; to a years Freelancer membership plus a choice between the intermediate reward levels. In between, the individual &#8216;swag&#8217; items on offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name on a Laser Etched Plaque on the machine</li>
<li>A 3D printed of the brand new Farset Labs logo</li>
<li>A 3D printed model of your choice, along with a timelapse video of your model being printed</li>
<li>Customised Farset Labs tee-shirt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> Kit and Personalised 3D printed Case</li>
<li>and Email and Video &#8220;Thank you&#8221; messages from the Directors</li>
</ul>
<h1>&#8220;But&#8230; But&#8230; But&#8230; I wanted 3D printing time?!&#8221;</h1>
<p>Ahh, but that&#8217;s the big story; 3D printing will be free for all membership levels and the consumable supplies will be taken out of the global community budget (once we run out of the specific 3D printer funds).</p>
<p>This freedom will be on a &#8216;fair use&#8217; basis; if you wish to do any larger scale manufacture, please <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">order</a> your own materials and feel free to use the printer here!</p>
<h1>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m sold, I&#8217;ll chuck a few quid in&#8221;</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw">Thank you!</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re running the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume</a> until Sunday the 18th of November, and hope to get your tasty tasty rewards out to you before Christmas, so please share this blog post to anyone who you think would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please let us know below or on the campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs is adopting a new membership model in the next few weeks to adapt to the different needs of the different types of members in the space. This both helps students and those of low income by significantly cutting the costs of membership, and provides a bed for more wealthy people to get access to more expensive features at a very low price compared to for-profit ventures.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The Current Model</h1>
<p>As all members will be aware, the current model of membership operates at a fixed amount payable each month, with a £5 discount for people with valid student cards at recognised academic institutions. At this time, the membership fee is £30 per month, making it £25 per month for students.</p>
<h1>Reasons for the change</h1>
<p>A lot of people have approached Farset Labs with the intention of joining, only to be discouraged from signing up due to the relatively high costs involved. This is most noticeable in students and those with lower incomes. These are precisely the kind of people Farset Labs needs to be vibrant, so we need to tailor to them first. Similarly, more professional members have expressed a wish for more business-like features and high-end features, which will be made available at a premium.</p>
<p>These changes were discussed at the<a title="Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/"> Town Hall</a> meeting this month and the community who attended accepted the plan.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>Some of the listed advantages (specifically the job board and Asterisk-based phone systems) are not available yet, but we&#8217;re pushing these administrative changes for new members out as quickly as possible to give Freshers coming to the Belfast area to study, and recent grads coming to work here, an even greater incentive to join the community.</p>
<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>The membership model will now be modelled with four distinct levels, each with different levels of access and varying features, and a proportionate price to match. These roles will cover from basic student membership up to “honorary” membership for those who wish to financially support Farset Labs or with to provide extra monetary help on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Our <a title="Membership" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Membership</a> page has been updated to reflect a summary of these roles</p>
<h2>Student Membership</h2>
<p>Student membership for Farset Labs will be priced at £15 per month and is available to all members with a valid student card at a recognised academic institution, and those attending a recognised school.</p>
<p>This level of membership offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the space while it is open, but not 24-hour access#;</li>
<li>Use of all equipment and tools in the space;</li>
<li>Access to the Internet and public network resources using both WiFi and the wired network;</li>
<li>Access to all events organised by Farset Labs;</li>
<li>The ability to use the event space and other rooms for meetings if they are free at the time;</li>
<li>Voting rights at Town Hall meetings and in all community polls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enthusiast Membership</h2>
<p>Enthusiast membership is priced at £25 per month and is aimed at hobbyists and enthusiasts, as well as students who want a higher level of access, particularly when it comes to online resources and access to the space 24/7. It is available to all members.</p>
<p>Enthusiast membership offers, in conjunction with the benefits of Student membership:</p>
<ul>
<li>24 hour access to the space, the ability to open the building and work on your own (with reasonable exceptions for renovations, etc);</li>
<li>Access to a VPN service at all times from outside the space;</li>
<li>A Project Box for storing equipment and tools belonging to the member;</li>
<li>A 3GB allocation for web space, email and NAS storage;</li>
<li>The ability to book the lounge, and workshop if they are free with a week’s notice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Freelancer Membership</h2>
<p>Freelancer membership is priced at £35 per month and is aimed at <em>young professionals, freelancers and startup founders</em> looking for more professional features and tools at their disposal. It is available to all members.</p>
<p>Freelancer membership offers, in addition to the benefits of Enthusiast membership:</p>
<ul>
<li>An increased quota for web space, email and NAS storage to 5GB;</li>
<li>The ability to book the event space if it is free with a week’s notice, but not the workshop;</li>
<li>A telephone extension on the main Farset Labs number;</li>
<li>A print quota of 60 pages per month;</li>
<li>A public profile on the Farset Labs website;</li>
<li>Posting rights to a job board in the space advertising services or the need for services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Angel Membership</h2>
<p>Angel membership is aimed at those wishing to support Farset Labs financially by giving a bit more than usual, perhaps because they like the idea or want to seed success.  It is available to all members.</p>
<p>The price of Angel membership is £75 per month and up; members paying £75 per month are deemed Angel members, but those wishing to give more are more than welcome to.</p>
<h1>Benefits for Current Members</h1>
<p>To thank current members for their early support for the space, current student members paying £25 per month <em>will be grandfathered into the Enthusiast membership plan</em>. Likewise, existing personal members paying £30 per month <em>will be grandfathered into the Freelancer membership plan</em>, saving them £5 per month.</p>
<p>This discount will apply for <em>as long as they maintain their current membership</em>; changing down to a lower level and switching back to Freelancer membership will incur a £35 per month membership cost as usual.</p>
<h1>Concessions for Starving Hackers</h1>
<p>At Farset Labs’ discretion, non-students may be offered a student rate, with the same access rights as Student membership, <em>minus voting rights</em>. This will be offered to those known to be in genuine need only and will not be overtly advertised. (Other than this blog post I guess&#8230;)</p>
