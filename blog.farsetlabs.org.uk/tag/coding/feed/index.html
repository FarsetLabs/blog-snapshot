<p>As the nights close in during October, warm your creative engine with some tasty <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">Game Jam</a> at Farset Labs. Our friends at <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> will be returning for a day-long game jam on <strong>Saturday 18th October</strong>, with a panel of independent game developers judging the winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> is a games jam event to build, bind and encourage the gaming community to make their ideas happen. This latest Belfast date forms part of a chain of GameCraft events starting back in 2012 with 120 people producing more than 35 games at the first event; since then it has been hosted in Belfast, Dublin, London, New York, and at huge national games events like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28923671">Insomnia</a>.</p>
<p>The jam is based on a secret theme, announced on the Saturday morning.</p>
<p>With that as your starting point, no matter your particular interests or skills, the task of making a game in a single day begins.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to a game jam before can tell you about the excitement of getting started, and the satisfaction of getting to the end &#8211; in between are the half-baked ideas that just about work, the quarter-baked short-cuts that work better than they deserve to, and the ages of concentration to get an animation right because it makes the character &#8220;just perfect&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fun ride, and GameCraft concentrates all of this into one day, so there&#8217;s none of the crazy-sleepless-zombie-coding seen at weekend jams.</p>
<p>Come to have fun! Come to share ideas or just compete! Most of all, come and make games!</p>
<p><strong>This is a BYOC event</strong>, but Farset can provide external monitors on request.</p>
<p>You can find more information about GameCraft, and <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">register for GameCraft Belfast, on their site</a>. <strong>Registration is required</strong> to take part.</p>
<p>Farset Labs Members can also take advantage of their <strong>free tickets</strong>. <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/free-members-tickets-for-gamecraft/556" target="_blank">Information on how to get your free tickets in our members forum</a></p>

<p>Summer can be either be downtime or uptime for kids, families and businesspeople alike. For our members who volunteer to run <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> at <a>Farset Labs</a> it could have been a good time to chill out. But noooooo, they&#8217;ve only gone and made more work for themselves.</p>
<p>This July and August, bring your kids to Farset Labs to learn their choice of the following, in four weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and program a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313">LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot</a>. The robot was part of the kit kindly donated to Farset by the <a href="http://nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre</a> for just this kind of hands-on learning. Well, it&#8217;s not just about the learning, right? It&#8217;s the errr&#8230;. Robots! <strong>UPDATE: LEGO sessions were booked-out in a couple of hours! Sorry. Hannah is taking names for more LEGO sessions in September, just email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></strong></li>
<li>Design a working computer game with <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>.</li>
<li>Design and build a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal CoderDojo will resume in September. See the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html">calendar for details</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand, while we have your attention, it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone that Farset has no public funding and is run by volunteers. No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/FL_DjSummer">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here</a>.</p>
<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer. I stayed up to the wee hours putting that abomination together. It&#8217;s MY abomination and I&#8217;m proud of it.</i></p>
