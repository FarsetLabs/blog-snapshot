<p><strong><em>Farset Dojo is changing; we&#8217;re skipping December and moving from Eventbrite to Zen; restarting on the 8th of February, running every fortnight.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hello followers and supporters of Farset Dojo and awesome Guardians of the Ninjas.</p>



<p>We had planned to run our next event on Friday the 7th of December but have decided to postpone the Dojos until after the New Year! This is to allow the champions and mentors (and the ninjas!) to enjoy the holiday season with their families and friends. We&#8217;re also moving from EventBrite to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/home">Zen</a> (the global Coder Dojo website).</p>



<p>Zen has fantastic <a href="https://coderdojo.com/resources/">resources</a> available to ninjas and mentors, and it gives us a nice change when it comes to registering who will be attending.</p>



<p>Sign up to the new and shiny Farset Dojo <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo-belfast">here</a> if you want to attend any future events. We&#8217;ll be back to running <strong>every fortnight</strong> from Friday the 8th of February at 7pm!<br /></p>



<p>If you want to mentor you just need to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo">register</a> at Farset Dojo or email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re super excited to get back into it in February, and we look forward to starting an awesome year with the ninjas.</p>



<p>______________</p>



<p>Happy Holidays, from Zoe &amp; Andrew</p>



<p>xxxx<br /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farset Dojo is back&nbsp;<strong>this Friday</strong> from 6pm to 8pm, and will be continuing on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of the month until the end of August.<br />
<span id="more-2873"></span></p>
<p>As usual, if attendees can bring their own machines that&#8217;s extremely helpful, and as usual, we&#8217;ll be doing weird and wonderful, self-driven projects from electronics, programming, web/game design, interactive art, and (my personal favourite) conductive ink!</p>
<p>Spaces are limited so please don&#8217;t book too far ahead if you&#8217;re not sure you can attend.</p>
<p>Volunteers always welcome of course! If you&#8217;d like to help out, give us a shout on dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>
<p>See you all soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Interested in getting hands experiences on with the BBC micro:bit, due to land in the hands of every Year 8 student in the summer term? Now’s your chance!</strong></p>
<p>Farset Labs will be running a free, hands on &#8220;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-bbc-microbit-tickets-22031409539" target="_blank">Getting started with the BBC micro:bit</a>&#8221; Computing at Schools Northern Ireland Hub workshop on the 10th March 2016 from 6:30pm-9:00pm at Farset Labs.<br />
<strong>We will hope to cover</strong><br />
&#8211; What is the micro:bit?<br />
&#8211; Getting started and making your first programs<br />
&#8211; Brief overview of the different programming environments available<br />
&#8211; More in depth look at Python on the micro:bit<br />
&#8211; Ideas for use in the classroom</p>
<p>We will have a few computers available at Farset, but if possible, please bring your own laptop.</p>
<p>If you have any queries or questions, feel free to drop myself (Andrew Mulholland, Outreach Manager @ Farset Labs) an email at andrew.mulholland@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>
<p>This event is supported by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cas_ni" target="_blank">Computing at Schools NI</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Do I need to have any previous programming experience?</strong><br />
Nope! We are targeting the workshop at those will little or no programming experience.</p>
<p><strong>I am not a secondary school level teacher (am a primary school teacher, higher education academic or from industry), can I come down and take part?</strong><br />
Unfortunately we expect high demand for this workshop so have to prioritise secondary teachers for now. If we still have space closer to the workshop, we would still love to see you there though. Put your name down for the waiting list for the &#8220;Other&#8221; ticket type and we will be in contact closer to the date.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demand, we well look into launching follow-on events for a wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to provide my own BBC micro:bit?</strong><br />
Nope! We have been kindly been provided a set by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything then I need to bring?</strong><br />
If you have a laptop running Windows, Mac OS or Linux, then it would be great if you could bring it. Although we have some computers available, it is better to learn and practice on familiar equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there free parking available nearby?</strong><br />
Yip! Weavers Court Business estate (which Farset Labs is located within) has ample onsite free parking.</p>

<h3>Info for Kids/Parents</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" rel="nofollow">CoderDojo</a> is a movement orientated around running not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p>
<p>At CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more.  In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and as well as developing key critical thinking and problem solving skills. It&#8217;s also a lot of fun!</p>
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;"><iframe src="//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=18085833214&amp;ref=etckt" width="100%" height="306" frameborder="0" marginwidth="5" marginheight="5" scrolling="auto"></iframe></p>

</div>
<p>We&#8217;ve also pre-booked between now and Christmas, at which point we&#8217;ll be taking a small break and will be relaunching in January. Those dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18115000454" target="_blank">16/10/15</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Info for Mentors</h3>
<p>Thanks to our recent &#8220;mentor drive&#8221;, we&#8217;ve got lots of new volunteers to help out with running this great programme. (<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-outreach-201516-call-for-mentors/" target="_blank">There&#8217;s always room for more!</a>)</p>
<p>As part of this new wave of mentors, we&#8217;re hosting an induction session this <strong>Wednesday</strong> between 17:30 and 19:30, sneaking in before the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GDGBelfast/" target="_blank">Google Developer Group</a> Meetup (although we can break out into the workshop if discussion continues).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re running late / can&#8217;t make it, but it&#8217;d be helpful if you could let outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk know if you&#8217;re no longer interested and we&#8217;ll take you off the mailing list.</p>
<p>This discussion will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introductions / Networking (&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m $NAME, ask me about $SKILLS, don&#8217;t ask me about $FEARS&#8221;)</li>
<li>Child Protection Policies / Emergency procedures</li>
<li>Worksheet / Equipment / Resource overviews</li>
<li>Communication preferences</li>
<li>Open forum for &#8220;cool things we should do&#8221;</li>
</ul>

</strong><br />
After a long summer hiatus, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> is relaunching at Farset Labs, under old management on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214" target="_blank">Friday the 2nd of October from 17:30 to 19:30</a>. We&#8217;re also unveiling separate FarsetDojo <a href="http://twitter.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> pages where we&#8217;ll be sharing what goes on, so give them a Follow and a Like to keep up to date with the latest Dojo happenings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=18085833214" alt="Eventbrite - Farset Labs CoderDojo" /></a></p>
<p>But this post isn&#8217;t (just) about that. Farset Labs was built around the idea of exploration and giving back to the wider community, presenting opportunities that people wouldn&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to.</p>
<p>Over the past three and a half years, we&#8217;ve helped so many people, young and not so young, engage with technology in a much more human way, and we do that on the strength of our mentors.</p>
<p>And basically, <strong>we need you</strong>!</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in helping out with <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>, or just want to put your name down on the &#8220;call out&#8221; list for our outreach events, please take two minutes and fill in the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/AiTPyxICVB" target="_blank">form</a> below. Your contact information will be private and you will only be contacted for relevant outreach activities.</p>
<p>Also you don&#8217;t have to be a Farset Labs <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/index.html" target="_blank">Member</a> to be a Mentor (but it always helps!), and if you&#8217;ve got any questions about Farset&#8217;s outreach programmes, give us a shout on <a href="mailto:outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>The kids worked through a number of challenges, the main being building their own reaction timer game using <a href="http://simplesi.net/scratchgpio/" target="_blank">ScratchGPIO</a>, a breadboard and a number of components.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1957" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2-534x10241.jpg" alt="2" width="534" height="1024" /></p>

<p>We also had a film crew in filming the Raspberry Jam from Fuzzy Duck (filming for TalkTalk) after Andrew won the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">Next Generation Digital Hero</a> award. They were making a film of what he does which included the Raspberry Jam. The short film should be out in a few weeks.</p>

<p>In between creating awesome reaction timer games, playing with RGB LEDs and hacking <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, the kids also found time to make use of the event space blackboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1961" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6-1024x6851.jpg" alt="6" width="670" height="448" /></p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams are now going to be running monthly! They will run on the second Saturday of every month.</p>
<p>The other 2 Raspberry Jams for this year are</p>
<ul>
<li>8th November 1pm &#8211; 5pm     &#8211; <a title="Farset Jam 6" href="http://bit.ly/farsetjam6" target="_blank">Get your tickets</a></li>

<div></div>
<div>All the dates for Coderdojo until Easter are now on the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-5770231919" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> ready for you to book your place.</div>
<p>As you maybe aware last year we did survey asking for your opinion on Coderdojo. The <a title="Results from CoderDojo Attendee Survey" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/results-from-coderdojo-attendee-survey/">results</a> showed we need to make some changes.</p>
<p>The changes that we&#8217;d like  to make to improve the Dojo in the new year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>More Structured Programmes</li>
<li>More Organisation</li>
<li>More P.R.</li>
<li>Starting Projects where the kids can work together</li>
</ul>
<p>The mentors will be meeting on Friday at 5.30pm in the Event Space to start planning these changes. If you wish to help us with these changes, please join us on Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest project  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>
