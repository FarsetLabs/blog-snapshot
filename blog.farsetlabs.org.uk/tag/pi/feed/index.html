										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday 11th October, 15 kids and their parents turned up at Farset Labs for the 5th <a title="European Code Week at Farset" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/european-code-week-at-farset/" target="_blank">Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam</a> as part of EU Code week.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/111.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1956" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11-1024x7681.jpg" alt="1" width="670" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>The kids worked through a number of challenges, the main being building their own reaction timer game using <a href="http://simplesi.net/scratchgpio/" target="_blank">ScratchGPIO</a>, a breadboard and a number of components.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1957" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2-534x10241.jpg" alt="2" width="534" height="1024" /></p>

<p>We also had a film crew in filming the Raspberry Jam from Fuzzy Duck (filming for TalkTalk) after Andrew won the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">Next Generation Digital Hero</a> award. They were making a film of what he does which included the Raspberry Jam. The short film should be out in a few weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1960" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5-1024x5751.jpg" alt="5" width="670" height="376" /></p>
<p>In between creating awesome reaction timer games, playing with RGB LEDs and hacking <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, the kids also found time to make use of the event space blackboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1961" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6-1024x6851.jpg" alt="6" width="670" height="448" /></p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams are now going to be running monthly! They will run on the second Saturday of every month.</p>
<p>The other 2 Raspberry Jams for this year are</p>
<ul>
<li>8th November 1pm &#8211; 5pm     &#8211; <a title="Farset Jam 6" href="http://bit.ly/farsetjam6" target="_blank">Get your tickets</a></li>

<p>We have some great news on the Raspberry Jam front in Northern Ireland! We&#8217;re planning to make our <a title="Return of Raspberry Jam" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/return-of-raspberry-jam/">Raspberry Jams</a> at Farset Labs a lot more frequent (instead of the current roughly every 6 months). We are looking into once a month or bimonthly.</p>
<p>Before we start though doing more frequent Raspberry Jams we want to grab some feedback from you, even if you have never attended a Raspberry Jam before.</p>
<p>Previous events have covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting Started with your Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Hardware interfacing for Scratch using <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>, <a href="http://cymplecy.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/scratch-gpio-version-2-introduction-for-beginners/">Scratch GPIO</a> and <a href="http://piborg.org/ledborg">LEDBorgs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> on your Pi</li>
<li>Building complex animations with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></li>
<li>And lots of sharing of individual projects like Bangor Academy&#8217;s <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/2013/01/25/pi-cade-project-team-at-bangor-academy/">PiCade</a>, a <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/?p=97">Lego PiBot</a>, some great Scratch games, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to figure out what you want to learn, what type of things you would like to see at a Raspberry Jam (Talks, Q&amp;As, hands on workshops etc).</p>
<p>So please take a few minutes to go through our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cr3AptTeKW7jGHnNc_yOdNTMiLkglObZunwhIzrCf0A/viewform" target="_blank">really quick anonymous survey</a>, you have the chance to give your opinion on what we do at the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams for the next few months!</p>
<p>We hope to announce the date of the first in the new series of Raspberry Jams within the next few days so keep an eye on the Farset labs blog and social media.</p>

<p>Friday night saw the Event Space in Farset Labs packed with eager attendees to Northern Ireland’s first ever <a href="raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a rapidly growing global network of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> users that regularly meet and, following the success of Friday’s Jam, Farset Labs is pleased to announce that the event will be joining our wide and eclectic event calendar as a monthly fixture.<br />
With the Event Space stuffed with in excess of thirty attendees, with an age-range stretching from six to sixty and abilities ranging from the simply curious to the robot-controlling masterminds of future world-domination. In respect to the latter, one of the most impressive projects on show was the use of a Pi to control an <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-gb/default.aspx?icmp=COUKFR26MINDSTORMS" target="_blank">NXT robotics system</a>; this was from a (impressively uniformed, for 7pm) sixth form student from <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/" target="_blank">Dalriada School</a>, giving weight to the hopes of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> that their innovation will ignite the passion for tinkering and technology in schools. Of course, not only is the Pi a wonderful development system, it can also run a variety of more consumer oriented tasks; if loaded up with <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank">RaspBMC</a> software, you now have an immensely capable <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/features/raspberry-pi-media-centre-tutorial" target="_blank">£25 media centre</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-912 alignright" title="IMG_3403 (Medium)" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium-300x2001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>After the scheduled session, the assembled users had the chance to mix, compare experiences and work collaboratively, demoing, among others, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=78&amp;t=18853" target="_blank">Quake 3 running on the Pi</a> and a system for the Pi built entirely from <a href="http://www.uk.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>, including a hacked screen from an in-car entertainment system and a jury-rigged powered USB hub with connections to a keyboard, mouse and wireless card.</p>
<p>Future sessions intend to cover alternative distributions (operating systems for the Raspberry Pi), strange use cases and hardware interfacing, both via direct link and also the <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gertboard/" target="_blank">Gertboard</a>. Suffice to say, having seen the users on Friday, the road ahead will be fast, interesting and, above all, full of unexpected turnings.</p>
<p>Check out the obligatory timelapse below, which is slightly cut off due to the fact that the level of activity throughout the day filled the modest card!</p>
<p>(Apologies for the awful, awful pun, but William Cully wasn&#8217;t available for consultation at 3am.)</p>
