<p>This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.</p>
<p>Since <em>before</em> day one, a 3D printer has been on the minds of the community (and plenty of people who have said that they would join the community if those facilities were available), and now, <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">we&#8217;re ready to rock</a>!<span id="more-698"></span></p>
<h1>&#8220;Hold on, what are you getting?&#8221;</h1>
<p>What we&#8217;re asking for is £2,000 for an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/ultimaker-kits.html">Ultimaker 3D Printer</a>, an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html">UltiController</a> (allowing members to print their plans directly from SD card), and several kilos of <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">ABS and PLA Plastic</a> to actually print, along with a rolling tool-table to keep all of the relevant parts in one &#8216;package&#8217; for easy use.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://blog.ultimaker.com/about/">Dutch</a> designed and manufactured kits can deposit 3mm diameter ABS or PLA plastic to an accuracy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0125+mm">12.5 micrometres</a>, in a potential build volume of over <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21x21x22+cm">2.5 gallons</a>, at a rate of a cubic centimetre every 7 seconds, at a rough cost of 4p/cm$^3$.</p>
<h1>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it just be bought outright?&#8221;</h1>
<p>Farset Labs serves a wide community with very disparate interests, from PS2 Clustering to Pinball repair. As such, it isn&#8217;t fair for the collective community to pay so much for one sector, especially if the interest in that sector is speculative. Beyond that argument, Farset Labs operates on a break-even basis at the minute and as such, simply can&#8217;t afford such a large investment at this time.</p>
<h1>&#8220;So what do I get for my hard earned donation?&#8221;</h1>
<p>There are nine donation reward levels, ranging from &#8216;Just feeling good about yourself&#8217; to a years Freelancer membership plus a choice between the intermediate reward levels. In between, the individual &#8216;swag&#8217; items on offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name on a Laser Etched Plaque on the machine</li>
<li>A 3D printed of the brand new Farset Labs logo</li>
<li>A 3D printed model of your choice, along with a timelapse video of your model being printed</li>
<li>Customised Farset Labs tee-shirt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> Kit and Personalised 3D printed Case</li>
<li>and Email and Video &#8220;Thank you&#8221; messages from the Directors</li>
</ul>
<h1>&#8220;But&#8230; But&#8230; But&#8230; I wanted 3D printing time?!&#8221;</h1>
<p>Ahh, but that&#8217;s the big story; 3D printing will be free for all membership levels and the consumable supplies will be taken out of the global community budget (once we run out of the specific 3D printer funds).</p>
<p>This freedom will be on a &#8216;fair use&#8217; basis; if you wish to do any larger scale manufacture, please <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">order</a> your own materials and feel free to use the printer here!</p>
<h1>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m sold, I&#8217;ll chuck a few quid in&#8221;</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw">Thank you!</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re running the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume</a> until Sunday the 18th of November, and hope to get your tasty tasty rewards out to you before Christmas, so please share this blog post to anyone who you think would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please let us know below or on the campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you wanted to fiddle with electronics but don&#8217;t have the equipment or knowledge?<img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-682" title="Massimo Bazai" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5537363317_7ee0c04ac4-198x3001.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="180" /></p>
<p><span id="more-680"></span>Last were contacted by an Italian Maker-collective called <a title="WeFab.it" href="http://www.wefab.it/" target="_blank">WeFab.it</a>, who are associated with the fantastic <a href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> project for electronics experimentation and prototyping.</p>
<p>They were kindly letting us know about a new RS sponsored video series walking through RS&#8217;s new <a title="Arduino Starter Kit" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7617355/?" target="_blank">Arduino Starter Kit</a> (£67), presented by Arduino co-founder <a href="http://www.massimobanzi.com/" target="_blank">Massimo Banzi</a> (yes, that is his real surname).</p>
<p>On Monday, they presented their first video, &#8220;Get to know your tools&#8221;. The video explains how to build a basic circuit with the Arduino board, and how to use each of the basic components such as LEDs, switches, and resistors. So if you are new to electronics, this is a must!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2X8d_r0p92U?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a programme of 10 videos lined up, finishing up with a Twitter Controlled Mood Lamp, which we here at Farset Labs will be really interested to see, considering our occasionally depressed Nabaztag&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been walking a few of the drop-ins through similar circuits, and these videos are going to be a great resource for education. And the Starter packs look pretty darned handy too&#8230;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Depending on the community response to these videos, we&#8217;re investigating getting a few of the educational packs for the space, so if you&#8217;d be interested in this, PLEASE let us know in the comments section!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Farset Labs team is still in the space at one in the morning &#8211; now that&#8217;s dedication!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMAG01591.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-176" title="IMAG0159" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMAG0159-300x1791.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="125" /></a>We went in this morning with no working network, no backbone connection, little equipment and no computers running. Over fourteen hard hours later, we now have every viable socket networked, switches installed, WiFi running, our <a href="http://www.tibusconnect.com/">Tibus</a> internet connection enabled, a PowerEdge running <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/overview.html">ESXi</a> with virtual machines, the <a href="http://www.rm.com/shops/rmshop/Product.aspx?cref=PD1430559">RM1</a> up and booted and some new equipment donated. The plumbers have been in and mostly fitted out the remaining toilet and we&#8217;re expecting the cooker shortly. The plumbing should be finished by Thursday night/Friday morning and the spark will be in again tomorrow to finish his work.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMAG0142-e13335855083581.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-175" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border-width: 0px;" title="IMAG0142" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMAG0142-e1333585508358-300x2721.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="163" /></a>Cleaning will take place tomorrow (er&#8230;today, Thursday &#8211; probably time to leave!) and we&#8217;ll finish up all the random little problems, such as the fact that our <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/18972-236251-236263-14638-f58-27718-21691-21696.html?dnr=1">laser printer</a> is in triage and one of the toilet doors is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facepalm">not quite ready</a> for Release Candidate status.</p>
<p>The space is still unquestionably in beta itself, but we&#8217;re proud of it and we think you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s rustic (aka, structurally-supported-entirely-by-plaster), but charming. It&#8217;s going to be an amazing home for the tech community in Belfast and I cannot wait for our doors to open officially at 3pm on Friday.</p>
<p>See you all then &#8211; I think we may go to bed soon!</p>

<p>Thank you very much to everyone who has offered to donate equipment to Farset Labs &#8211; we&#8217;re very grateful, as members&#8217; generosity is what has allowed us to start.</p>
<p>However, none of it is in the space yet, so we&#8217;d like to let you know that today (Wednesday 4th April), Farset Labs will be open for the dropping off of equipment from 11am to 6pm.</p>
<p>If you need something bulky picked up, we can send out reinforcements equipped with a trailer and if these times don&#8217;t suit you, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in contact (david@farsetlabs.org.uk or eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk) to arrange a more convenient slot.</p>
<p>We advise that you give us a heads up before you come round to Farset Labs, as we may be away for short periods doing pick-ups of bulky items, but we&#8217;ll do our best to have someone around to let people in.</p>
<p>If you would like to add your equipment to the list of donations, we&#8217;d be very grateful. To do so, fill out our short donation form at <a title="Donate to Farset" href="http://bit.ly/donatetofarset" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/donatetofarset</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday 6th April, 1500 &#8211; Saturday 7th April 1500</p>
<p>This is our &#8216;soft launch&#8217; event running with no equipment, no budget, very little furniture, no PR and a case of beer.</p>
<p>Entry will be <strong>£5, or Free for members</strong> (Sign-up will be available on-site, hint hint), and we&#8217;ll try and get some munchies/a few drinks in for everyone.</p>
<p>Repeat: <em>We will have very few toys other than what can be donated</em>, but we finally have a space with power and a network.</p>
<p>We can hack the building together (or apart, within reason) and start bringing the dream alive.<span id="more-103"></span></p>
