										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After going through due process, the desk usage policy has been updated to: explicitly state that un-rented desks should be cleared after use; that members have the right to move equipment left on un-rented desks to communal storage areas; which desks are currently rented/hot-desk/communal; and implementing standard COSHH practices.<span id="more-2931"></span></p>
<p>Here at Farset Labs, we started off with a relatively simple, if comprehensive, sets of <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">Rules, Policies, and Codes of Conduct</a>, covering the use of the space, equipment in the space, and the guidelines that we as a community agree to abide to.</p>
<p>99% of these can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the space better than you found it.</li>
<li>Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sometimes it becomes necessary to be a little more explicit about the expectations of the wider community. Two issues that have been raised with the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/">management and director teams</a> occasionally but persistently since day one is &#8220;someone left a desk covered in junk, what do?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this desk rented?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://farsetlabs.slack.com/archives/C03G2CK5J/p1527063330000063">Around May time</a>, discussions in the Slack boiled up to a point where the Directorship and Management teams realised that for about a year we&#8217;d been discussing a &#8220;Clear Desk Policy&#8221; that we were absolutely sure we definitely, definitely, had one that said &#8220;clear up your stuff when your done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oops.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>So, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koEeVoujnw3RIsW0fy_TxjXLvebNwtC0V7OWSbBGKZY/edit#heading=h.ljhyi1zcfx4r">June Town Hall</a>, I raised <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Gbpx3m7K2IdUzjPjvuPLP4QbLGaG3riKGkQPGybypQ/edit#slide=id.p">a proposal</a> to address a few simultaneous issues around &#8216;where should be clear, who should clear it, and where can I put stuff?&#8217;. This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.</p>
<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling. We have since day one had an explicit exclusion on firearms/ammunition , explosives, Offensive weapons, Unlicensed radio equipment, large quantities of combustibles, inflammables, or pressurised gases, stolen equipment, or banned substances. However, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed from the <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/f90919fa0711f5e816a2f2252912d0bbd8ab4860#diff-d39a174faa68201faf0c6caaf6c912ba">old rules</a>, &#8216;large quantities&#8217; was never defined, so naturally we eventually got a couple of reports of members effectively bulk buying both high end solvents and pressurised containers on the cheap, and stashing them in boxes somewhere&#8230; So David Kane and Colin Kelsey took on the task in writing up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8u9mFUWM5no0mWuirTc53Zq5wBjiHrlaIC0Z-wNEOQ/edit">their own proposal</a> to expand and extend the coverage of our COSHH policies, that was similarly unanimously ratified at the June Town Hall.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of behind the scenes process; that doesn&#8217;t mean in &#8216;Farset Land&#8217; that the new rules came in to force; just that the community had agreed in principal to the rough outlines; the proposal still needed to be turned in to the actual changes required in the Rules, Policy&#8217;s and Codes of Conduct to bring them up to speed with the proposal; if it&#8217;s not <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">on the website</a> it&#8217;s not a real rule.</p>
<p>Since moving our website to <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/tree/21817e4c38c251fa5149f7cc8574e0322c8757f0">Github hosted Markdown in 2013</a>, any changes to &#8216;the rules&#8217; have been recorded and mostly Pull-Request/Reviewed as part of the ratification process in order to be as open as possible. We&#8217;re not always perfect at this but we&#8217;re getting better about being as transparent and open as possible and not just rushing through rule changes without consultation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/165">COSHH pull request</a> was relatively simple to review and merge as it was mostly technical and &#8216;edge case&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/164">Desk Rental pull request</a> was a bit more complex, with members of the community collaborating and beating out the policy changes to cover any edge cases, and was signed off on at last nights&#8217; Town Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant&#8221; changes in this policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently-Rented Hot-Desks, are indicated as in red on the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">Facilities page</a>, and it is the responsibility of the Directors and NEMs to keep this up to date.</li>
<li>Any desks labeled in green in the facilities diagram are available for Rental</li>
<li>All Green and Blue desks are subject to a clear desk policy, which means these desks must be cleared of all equipment (on or under) before leaving the space</li>
<li>Any equipment left unattended at such desks can be moved by any member to common storage facilities.</li>
<li>Two desks in the workshop are being opened up to being rented.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to thank the members who made it out last week to blitz and &#8220;defrag&#8221; the whole space; it&#8217;s survived a week without turning back in to a tip which is always a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="VID 20180730 WA0003 2" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQMmesROYK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s a little notification/story from the governance of Farset; as a reminder, Town Halls are held on the first Monday of the month in the Event Space at 7pm and are open to both members and interested-non members (however non-members can&#8217;t vote). A lot of Farsets&#8217; day-to-day governance <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">is handled in our Slack</a>, which, again, is open to both members and non-members.</p>
<p>If there are any questions or ideas about how governance is handled, we&#8217;re more than happy for those to be discussed publicly on Github or Slack, or privately by emailing info@farsetlabs.org.uk, or admin@farsetlabs.org.uk if there is something sensitive to be discussed.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />
<i>Please note: </i>You must be over 18 on the 26th of January in order to participate.</p>
<p class="p1">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a> or ask us questions via <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a> </span>or <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a> with the #farsetggj18 hashtag.</p>

We&#8217;ve been quietly toiling away in the background to bring the movers, shakers and taste makers of the UK Maker Community  (and beyond!) to Belfast for a one day mini-conference, set up to tear down some misconceptions about the community and to address some of the unique challenges faced in our region.</p>

</p>
<p>But the speakers don&#8217;t make the conference; the attendees do, and while we&#8217;re not publishing our invited attendee list, it&#8217;s pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>The conference will explore a series of topics around making, with a focus on critical discussion about the current state of the maker culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:00</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration and coffee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:30</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome address</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10:45</span> <b>Session 1: Making &amp; Peace Building</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kicking off Maker Assembly NI is a session about the politics and nuances of community-facing digital fabrication projects. It will look at how maker cultures are emerging at the grassroots and how local organisations are contributing to the peace-building project currently underway in Northern Ireland. It hopes to reveal how the idea of ‘critical making’ can be adjusted to suit the specificities of different contexts.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Wallace &amp; Eamon Durey, Fab Labs NI, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Peto, Nerve Centre</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12:00</span> <b>Session 2: Speculative Making: New Contexts and Futures</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the idea of digital making beds down—and practices become more visible and accessible—what new trajectories are emerging and how are speculative futures being framed? This session hopes to reveal the supports we might need to maintain a critical forecast of making and maker culture.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nora O’Murchu, University of Limerick, </span><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Kat Braybrooke, University of Sussex</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13:00</span> <b>Lunch</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">14:00</span> <b>Session 3: Governance, Sustainability &amp; Maker Networks</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are maker networks nurtured and sustained? And how ‘critical&#8217; are the governance </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategies of the physical spaces and networked platforms that mediate maker networks? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This session hopes to somewhat unravel the entanglements of people, places, and things, to better understand how maker culture is being facilitated.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Speakers:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Javier Burón, Fab Lab Limerick &amp; University of Limerick, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannah Stewart, Royal College of Art, Future Makerspaces Project</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15:30</span> <b>Session 4: Critics of the world, create!</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final session to be a making exercise, inspired by the Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska’s (2012) Creative Media Manifesto and Garnet Hertz’s Critical Making zine series.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17:00</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing remarks and Networking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">18:00</span> Bus to the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pub &#8211; BREWBOT</span><a href="http://www.brewbotbelfast.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.brewbotbelfast.com/</span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help us understand the needs of our member base, and to point us toward the areas we need to improve upon, we&#8217;ve come up with a short member survey for the New Year. This contains questions regarding each of our management areas, and should help us to improve Farset Labs to better serve you.</p>
<p>The survey is open to all members, regardless of membership duration or level. (Management included!)</p>
<p>All active members have been emailed with this survey, and so far roughly 50% have responded. It&#8217;s quite possible that some of the email addresses we&#8217;ve used are old and inactive, however. <strong>If you&#8217;re a current member and haven&#8217;t already received a link to our survey, please email us (admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) and let us know!</strong></p>
<p>The survey will close at <strong>Midnight on Tuesday 19th January</strong>. Once the survey closes, the results will be published, along with our plans!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that we&#8217;re playing host to the first Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) &#8220;Policy Hack&#8221; day tomorrow morning from 9:30am.</p>
<p>So what is a Policy Hack? It&#8217;s a way to bring together policy makers from across the community and voluntary sector, activists, trade unionists, academics, business people, civil servants and members of the public with an interest in the topics to attack issues experienced across a range of themes using a different perspective; the experimental, iterative, and &#8220;agile&#8221; practices common in the technology and digital creative sectors.<a href="http://www.nicva.org/article/hacking-our-way-better-outcomes"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Farset Labs is hosting this programme in our inspirational event space, which should create the atmosphere of open collaboration and knowledge sharing that is often lacking in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.nicva.org/event/working-poverty-policy-hack">first event</a> is focused on finding alternative solutions to the current quagmire that is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27981975">working poverty</a>; where due to a range of factors, individuals and families remain below the poverty line despite being partly or even fully employed.</p>
<p>For more information about NICVA&#8217;s programme of events, <a href="http://www.nicva.org/article/hacking-our-way-better-outcomes" target="_blank">check out their website</a>. <a href="http://www.nicva.org/event/working-poverty-policy-hack">Tomorrow&#8217;s event</a> will run from 9:30 to 17:30 and there are just a few spots left, but to express interest in future events, sign up <a href="http://www.nicva.org/event/working-poverty-policy-hack" target="_blank">here</a> anyway!</p>

<p>Alternatively, if there&#8217;s something private you&#8217;d like to discuss with the directors, either contact them generally on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk, or individually on bolster@farsetlabs.org.uk, eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk or david@farsetlabs.org.uk.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is anything you&#8217;d like to raise anonymously, we&#8217;ve set up the below form to submit your issues.</p>
<p>Farset Labs is what you make of it and we aren&#8217;t psychic; we can&#8217;t do it without you&#8217;re support, guidance, and ideas.</p>

<p>This Sunday! (Thanks for that guys&#8230; :P)</p>
<p>Anyway, standard Gathering of Lightning rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Flying pigs after 7 minutes</span></li>
<li>No Presentation tools (Prezi, Powerpoint, Keynote, Beamer, etc)</li>
<li>Arbitrary order or presenters</li>
<li>Heckling Encouraged</li>
</ul>
<p>(Unconfirmed) Presentations offered by the community over the thought process of this so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Chrome OS: Are you ready to live in the cloud?</span></li>
<li>Ruby/Javascript/Io/Twillo/Erlang/Go/Linguistics (One person offered these&#8230; brave lad)</li>
<li>Parallelism in Web Programming</li>
<li>Windows 8/Windows Mobile App Certification processes / pains</li>
<li>Dr Strangethings, or How I learned to stop worrying and love Rapid Prototyping</li>
<li>Probably more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it&#8217;s short notice, we&#8217;ve got no sponsor for this one, but we&#8217;ll grab a few crates to drink and people are, as always, free to BYO Food/Drink.</p>
