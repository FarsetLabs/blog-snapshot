										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again, where we come together and share some of the madness that we&#8217;ve been making, either in our professional or project-based lives and try to bring ourselves up from the depths of exploration to explain it to other human beings who haven&#8217;t been living and breathing this stuff. It&#8217;s also a great opportunity to pop in and see the changes made in the space recently, or just to pop in and say hello!</p>
<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a <strong>beer</strong>, soft drink, <strong>pizza</strong> and <strong>fresh fruit</strong> intermission. (Many thanks to <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10446" target="_blank">BCS Belfast</a> for sponsoring these!)</p>
<p><strong>The rules</strong> for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of<strong> 7 minutes</strong> to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li><strong>No Slides!</strong> The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic <strong>on the blackboard</strong> along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so<strong> be nice to him/her</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Punishment</strong> for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" rel="nofollow">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>

</div>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get a little social in the mean time; we&#8217;ve also got a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1471922459770954/" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> but this <strong>will not be used for attendance tracking</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RupertWhitehead/posts"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2043" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RupertWhitehead312.jpg" alt="RupertWhitehead312" width="350" height="350" /></a>We&#8217;re pleased to announce that next Wednesday 21st Jan, we&#8217;re hosting <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RupertWhitehead/posts" target="_blank">Rupert Whitehead</a>, Developer Relations Regional lead at Google, responsible for the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, for an evening of discussion and collaboration around Google&#8217;s ecosystem of products.</p>
<p>Rupert runs the <a href="https://developers.google.com/groups/" target="_blank">Google Developer Groups</a>, Launchpads, <a href="https://developers.google.com/startups/" target="_blank">Startup Launch</a> and<a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/" target="_blank"> Google Developer Experts</a> programs in the region. His main focus is to help developers and startups become more successful with Google&#8217;s APIs. Prior to Google Rupert worked at Nokia and Symbian. He is a member of the <a href="http://www.cim.co.uk/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>With such an amazing speaker coming through the area to engage and grow the Google Developer Network in the province, and thanks to a serendipitous introduction by <a href="https://twitter.com/grib">Grib</a> at our Weavers Court neighbours, <a href="http://www.purpleguerrilla.com/">Purple Guerrilla</a>, we&#8217;re pulling an old trick out of the closet&#8230; The concept is simple. Pitch Per Square Foot.</p>
<p>We have approx 30 square meters of blackboard. About 322 sqft in old money. We guestimate that about 250 of that is usable by the average human.</p>
<p>Each attendee has a little over a square foot to describe themselves, make an impact, and leave enough contact details to be got in touch with.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-640" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg" alt="gilchrist2" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>That’s the gimmick. The real draw is the community. As we’ve grown, Farset Labs has developed an amazing community of technologists and business leaders (often in the same body). We want to provide the ultimate relaxed ‘networking’ environment where no one person can bogart the floor with their confidence, or the quiet one gets ignored.Everyone has a square foot*. Going over the lines will be punished by having your square wiped out and given to someone else. Inter-square war will be treated similarly, unless its really funny, in which case, we’ll allow it.</p>
<p>We used this process <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/" target="_blank">very successfully</a> over a year and a half ago and I&#8217;m glad we can use it again.</p>
<p>After everyone has started to get to know each other, Rupert will be talking about his work at Google, covering a huge range of topics from the evolution of Web APIs and building UX ecosystems through to Wearables and new form factors.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;ll be an opportunity for all attendees to discuss their ideas and maybe come up with some brilliant solutions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our long running, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_%28event%29">Ignite</a> / <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/faq">Petcha Kutcha</a> -minus-the-presentations-plus-a-giant-blackboard-and-foam-projectiles speaker series is back, with a slightly festive feel! Normal rules apply; Speakers have 7 minutes to talk about something they&#8217;re passionate about, with audience heckling encouraged, and the opportunity for a few more minutes of Q&amp;A after at the compères discretion. This time around, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/clairedotw">Claire Wilgar </a>will be compère-ing (we expect Christmas Hats!) and for a change we have a rough idea of whose talking!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jiannhughes.com/" target="_blank">Jiann Hughes</a> will be talking about her work in the intersection between Art, Culture, and Technology</li>
<li>Colin Kelsey/Matt Hazely will be explaining some of the beer brewing techniques they are experimenting with in the labs</li>
<li>Will Burr from Billy Goat Entertainment will be demoing some of his currently-<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1236117571/her-majestys-spiffing" target="_blank">Kickstarting</a> game, Her Majesty&#8217;s Spiffing</li>
<li>Dr David Laverty, for Queen&#8217;s University Belfast&#8217;s Energy, Power and Intelligent Systems (EPIC) group, who are working on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/QUBEV" target="_blank"> converting a classic DeLorean to an Electric drive train</a></li>
<li>Sebastian Heinz from SARC will <strong>hopefully</strong> be demoing his wildly successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2012099678/patchblocks-programmable-mini-synth-modules" target="_blank">Patchblocks</a> project that has already obliterated its £10k funding goal</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll also <strong>hopefully</strong> have a visit from some developers from <a href="http://www.aepona.com" target="_blank">Aepona</a>, a locally based API-as-a-service company recently acquired by <a href="http://www.aepona.com/intel-and-aepona/" target="_blank">Intel</a></li>
<li>Finally, we&#8217;re <strong>hoping</strong> to get a short talk on some of the work done by PWC&#8217;s Belfast Based Digital Forensic Team</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we try to keep a few slots open for walk ins, so if you feel inspired to talk about something, let us know! Drinks and munchies are provided by the brilliant folks at the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">British Computing Society</a>, who have supported us throughout our <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightening/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> programme for the past year and a half.</p>
