<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>And to kick things off, an apology; our provisionally scheduled Raspberry Jam on the 12th has been postponed until after the exam season as it&#8217;s been difficult to get people able to help out at the event. Raspberry Jam will return February</p>
<h1>GoL: Thur 17th Jan<a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189138854?ref=ebtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189138854&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - Gathering of Lightning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-958" alt="light-wide" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/light-wide-300x1511.jpg" width="300" height="151" /></a></h1>
<p>Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Update] Brendan Drain from Brain and Nerd, who had recent success with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nyphur/predestination-a-turn-based-space-4x-strategy-game">Predestination</a>, will be talking about how he got started in Games Development (and what to avoid!)</li>
<li>[Update] Niall Bole, Engineer, Gamer, Organiser, and Placement student at NACCO will be talking about &#8216;Using <a href="http://www.ashtoncentre.com/fablab">Fablabs</a> for Fun and Profit&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMathematicsandPhysics/Research/ResearchStudents/StudentInfo/?id=540">Colin Kelsey</a>, from QUB&#8217;s Centre for Plasma Physics, with what he describes as &#8220;either functional plasma physics or a big surprise&#8221;</li>
<li>Rebecca Lutton, a mechanical engineer of <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Bright-Club-Belfast-Bright-Club-Belfast-9-Women-on-Top">Bright Club </a>fame with &#8216;Observational Humerology &#8211; The curse of innuendo&#8217;</li>
<li>Andrew Bolster on getting your Raspberry Pi to talk to the real world using the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a></li>
<li>Dylan Wylie, another Physicist, who is ambiguously talking about &#8216;<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3shy07.jpg">Quantum Theory, Maybe</a>&#8216;</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all our lighting events, this is an open call, so even if you just want to say something on the night, we&#8217;ll have the blackboard grid up so can literally sign up to talk during the other talks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also hopefully be live streaming this one&#8230; maybe&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189138854?ref=ebtn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" alt="Eventbrite - Gathering of Lightning" src="http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189138854" /></a></p>
<h1>Global Game Jam Flacknite: Fri 25th<a href="http://flacknite-ggj13.eventbrite.com/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-959" alt="ggjlogo1dates" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ggjlogo1dates-300x521.png" width="300" height="52" /></a></h1>
<p>This time around we&#8217;re collaborating with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster&#8217;s Office of Innovation</a> to run the 2013 Northern Ireland <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">Global Game Jam</a></p>
<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world&#8217;s largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games… while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don’t code can contribute to a game.</p>
<p>This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Donations are not required for this event</strong> as refreshment costs are covered by <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">UUOI</a>, but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!<br />
<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189530024?ref=ebtn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" alt="Eventbrite - Flacknite - GlobalGameJam 2013" src="http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189530024" /></a></p>
<h1>Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com" rel="attachment wp-att-960"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960" alt="logo" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo-150x1501.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></h1>
<p>After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi (including the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>)</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, <strong>but please try and BYO monitor.</strong> We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, if anyone would like to present any projects or just help out with the organisation of this event (or give feedback based on the last events) get in touch with us via events@farsetlabs.org.uk (or any of the dozen or so other ways you&#8217;ll be able to get us on!)</div>
</div>

<p>This Sunday! (Thanks for that guys&#8230; :P)</p>
<p>Anyway, standard Gathering of Lightning rules apply:</p>

<li>Dr Strangethings, or How I learned to stop worrying and love Rapid Prototyping</li>
<li>Probably more!</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>3D printer is <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer" target="_blank">85% funded</a>, well done everyone!</li>
<li>Town Hall meeting on Friday the 16th at 5:30</li>
<li>Informal (read: unsponsored) Flacknite Lite next weekend (17-18th) to hack at the internals of Farset&#8217;s management</li>
<li>Welcome the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider" target="_blank">Supercollider</a> user group to our Wednesday Schedule</li>
<li><a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> event on the 29th Nov, BYO-Pi</li>
<li>My appearance on the <a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/2012/11/tech-show-podcast-episode-26/" target="_blank">NI Tech Show Podcast</a> with <a href="http://ichristaylor.com/" target="_blank">Chris Taylor</a> and <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/" target="_blank">Matt Johnson<span id="more-720"></span></a></li>
</ul>
<h1>3D Printer Updates</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image91.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-725" title="image9" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image9-300x3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>We&#8217;re all amazed and humbled by the support being given to the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer" target="_blank">3D printing Fundraiser</a>. We&#8217;re proud to be the first &#8216;Technology&#8217; entry on Sponsume, and we&#8217;re so very nearly there you can almost taste it.</p>
<p>In terms of some of the awesome ways people are planning to use the printer, some have really stuck in my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatrical set design models for lightning tests,</li>
<li>Architectural prototyping,</li>
<li>Customised Bow Riser (Handles) for Archers</li>
<li>CCTV Camera Camouflage</li>
<li>3D Printed 3D Scanner (3D-Ception&#8230;?)</li>
</ul>
<div>And it goes without saying that the mad group that is &#8216;our community&#8217; are going to come up with more crazy and strange ways to experiment with the new hardware.</div>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching Farset from the outside, now is a brilliant time to get involved; the top two tiers of donation include a year&#8217;s Enthusiast and Freelance membership respectively.</p>
<p>With 8 days to go and just under £300 to find, if you haven&#8217;t already, please consider making a donation, and you&#8217;ll get <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/reward/2924" target="_blank">cool stuff</a> in return.</p>
<h1>Town Hall</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-503767/Big-Brother-Britain-How-earn-Are-gay-Town-Hall-chiefs-ordered-out.html"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-724" title="townhallDM2012_468x351" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/townhallDM2012_468x351-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Last <a title="Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/" target="_blank">Town Hall meeting</a> was in late September, and it&#8217;s high time, given the changes ad improvements in the space since then, that we all had a face to face chat.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;re going to have a Town Hall meeting booked this coming Friday between 5:30 and 7:00. It&#8217;s hopefully not going to take that long to sort everything out.</p>
<p>On the agenda at the minute (if you want to add anything, let us know in one of the many ways):</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Update</li>
<li>3D Printer Update / Purchasing / Consumable Selection (i.e., if you want to pick the colours of the 3D printer, come to this meeting!)</li>
<li>Potential Project Funding ideas</li>
<li>Equipment rollout (Workshop)</li>
<li>Establishment of Training for members in how to use the space / Health and Safety</li>
<li>AOB (All other business / opportunity to rant)</li>
</ul>
<h1> Flack-Lite?</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-723" title="spamlite" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png" alt="" width="228" height="234" /></a>Since this holiday season is a bit heavy on the tech-events, such as the brilliant  <a href="http://2012.buildconf.com/" target="_blank">Buildconf</a> this week (Good Luck <a href="https://twitter.com/andymcmillan" target="_blank">Andy</a>!), Kainos&#8217; <a href="http://www.healthhackni.com/home.html" target="_blank">HealthHackNI</a> in the city hall in early December, and the wealth of &#8216;Office Nights Out&#8217;, we decided that there&#8217;s little point in scraping together another Full Blown Flacknite before &#8217;13.</p>
<p>So instead, we&#8217;re going to have a casual, BYOPizza <strong>Flack-Lite</strong> weekend, where the space will be open to all, and the theme will be improving Farset Labs&#8217; infrastructure.</p>
<p>Current projects in the todo list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Membership Management</li>
<li>Redo Website</li>
<li>Improve door control (and possibly a proper app!)</li>
<li>Improve FarBot to be smarter</li>
<li>Exposing *something* from the CCTV system to the membership</li>
<li>Building Time-Lapse table for the 3D Printer</li>
</ul>
<div>And More I&#8217;m sure will come to us.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There will be the usual selection of muchies and drinks, but these will be paid for from the community fund, so please, either BYO or make a representative donation.</div>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll have a great deal of awesome projects to show  next week, or at least will have moved along some of our more stubborn issues.</p>
<h1>User Groups</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-722" title="icon.supercollider" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif" alt="" width="62" height="63" /></a>We currently have a full roster of User Groups this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>14th: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> (Algorithmic Music Generation)</li>
<li>21st: <a href="http://belfastjs.org/" target="_blank">BelfastJS</a> (JavaScript, currently with Arduino and Cars)</li>

<li>5th: <a href="https://twitter.com/PyBelfast" target="_blank">PyBelfast</a> (Python, possibly something Raspberry Related, see below)</li>
</ul>
<div>Since we&#8217;re now technically &#8216;At Capacity&#8217;, if any other user groups want to run, we&#8217;ll shuffle things around to try and be fair to everyone, and this will be on a case by case basis.</div>
<h1>Raspberry Jam</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-721" title="cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.16" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png" alt="" width="800" height="116" /></a><a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">On Thursday the 29th, we&#8217;re hosting a Raspberry Jam.</a></p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their <strong>Raspberry Pi to good use</strong>. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This will be Farset Labs&#8217; first Raspberry Pi centred event, and if successful, will be built into the event calendar.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a<strong> Farset Labs Members event,</strong> so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
</div>
<div></div>

<h1>And Finally: NI Tech Show</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-726" title="the-tech-show-art" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png" alt="" width="142" height="142" /></a>Light one to finish things off.</p>
<p>I was invited onto the #<a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/category/tech/the-tech-show/" target="_blank">NITechShow</a> podcast last week leading to one of the <a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/2012/11/tech-show-podcast-episode-26/" target="_blank">longest editions</a> that Chris or Matt have done recently (sorry guys) covering a fair amount of the local and global tech news, including the Good the Bad and the Ugly of Microsoft software and hardware (specifically my clicky keyboard), Geeky Christmas gifts for kids (and big kids), a load of events coming up in the NI area, and a big &#8216;ol rant from me about Farset Labs right at the end.</p>

<p>We all loved the idea of Gathering Of Lightning, but the PR for it was slightly neglected (mea culpa). Not this time!</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 31st, we&#8217;re doing it all over again. Beer, Pizza, and Lightning fast discussions from a range of selected speakers from our own community.</p>
<p>While there will be plenty of time to chat on the day, if you want to &#8216;book&#8217; a speaking slot, get in touch in any of the dozen or so ways that are available!</p>

All major functionality has now been moved to the much higher spec&#8217;ed Farbot.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now got two in-house <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pis</a> for any members to fiddle with. Ask one of the Directors and they&#8217;ll usually know where one of them is!</p>
<p>The Eventspace lighting is being updated, but even in the midst of that we were happy to host the<a title="Farset Labs plays host BBC Creative Collisions Clinic" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-plays-host-bbc-creative-collisions-clinic/"> BBCNI Creative Collisions Event</a>, which was, in the words of the organisers, &#8216;a lot more successful than we had expected&#8217;.</p>

<div>But the <strong>&#8216;Big News&#8217;</strong> is the codification of our long term monthly events calendar. We&#8217;ve had a lot of fun over the past two months playing with different events and different arrangements, and while we&#8217;re still more than likely going to shift things around, we&#8217;re launching eight new regular events, bringing our regular monthly calendar to a fantastic twelve events! (Noone expects you to go to all of them by the way!);</div>

<li><a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/HacksHackers">HacksHackers</a></li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Music Mondays</strong> is a technology and music crossover <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Music_Mondays">event</a> held on the first Monday of the month, with scope for everything from synthesiser building, MIDIfying everything, chiptune circuit bending, realtime interactive compositions, or just &#8216;heres my mix, what do you think&#8217;.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Wildcard(*) User Group</strong> is where every Wednesday, we open the space for free to local technology user groups to meet and experiment. If you have an idea for a User Group for a technology you can&#8217;t live without (or just want to know more about) or if you are already part of a user group and want to book a slot, get in touch! Or just <a href="http://www.doodle.com/tdc889w2u5itpzg5">VOTE</a> for the groups you want allocated.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Gathering of Lightning</strong> as <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightening/">already been on the cards for a while</a>, but we&#8217;re making it regular. On the first Saturday of each month, we&#8217;re going to hold a series of lightning talks, where anyone with an interest or passion about or around tech can do a bit of a rant. Very informal, and very relaxed athmosphere. If you want to submit a talk, just add it to the wiki page!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>FEAST/FAMINE</strong> is an obscure abbreviation that one of the directors came up with that is a informal takeaway/pizza night every first Sunday of the month for members. Come, order, eat and relax. Once I learn the darned acronym, I&#8217;ll let you know.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Legitimate Business</strong> is a series of commercial, corporate, governmental and entrepreneurial best practise events held on the second Tuesday of each month, including guest speakers from the local (and hopefully, international) business and entrepreneurial community. If you&#8217;ve got anything you&#8217;d like us to cover, or you&#8217;re a business service provider who would like to present, get in touch or add it to the wiki!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Town Hall Tuesdays</strong> are a monthly opportunity for the membership to get together to discuss any problems or ideas they are having with the space or the community in an open, physical, forum.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>We&#8217;re holding a <strong>Coffee Morning </strong>on the morning of the second Friday of the month, as an chance for people to get together and close out the end of the week with a brew. Simples!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The <strong>Learning Zone</strong>, held in the afternoon of the second Saturday of the month consists of a series of community generated lectures/courses/classes where members can share their experiences in a bit more depth than is afforded in the Gathering of Lightning events. As usual, members are free to submit their ideas to the <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Learning_Zone">wiki</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Art-A-Tech</strong> is a programme of collaborative events being run on the third Thursday of the month, between Farset Labs and a crack pair of UU Media researchers with a history of <a href="http://foursquaremayorchair.tumblr.com/makers">interesting interplays between technology and culture</a>. The aim of the series is to bring artists and technologists together and see what magic happens!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>We all know and love <strong>Flacknite</strong>, so we&#8217;re running the <a title="Flacknite Roundup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/flacknite-roundup/">24hr extravaganza</a>  every third weekend.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The <strong>Open Data Playground</strong> will be held every fourth Thursday of the month, where data-geeks (and wannabe data-geeks), web devs, graphic designers, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">*QL</a> sorcerers, can hang out and play with bits. We&#8217;re hoping to put on some commercially sponsored data-challenges and competitions to make things interesting.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>And to close off the week, we&#8217;re holding a Belfast <strong>HacksHackers</strong> chapter on the fourth Saturday of the month.  It’s for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>And that&#8217;s our month! Most of these events are still in the &#8216;ironing out&#8217; stages, and we&#8217;re open to offers of corporate sponsorship for individual events to offset any catering costs, but hopefully this gives Farset a bit more consistent structure. <strong>Our first event of this new and improved events schedule will be the Open Data Playground on the 28th of June. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you&#8217;ve been tickled by any of these events, don&#8217;t hesitate to get involved in the wiki pages linked above! And if you&#8217;ve been waiting on the sidelines for some magic to happen before joining; <a title="Membership" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">now is the time to commit</a>! (No committment required actually, but you know what I mean!)</div>
