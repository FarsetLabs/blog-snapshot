<p>With my imminent departure for Nicaragua looming, I have the immense honour of welcoming Conor Robinson as our new incoming director, having been voted-in by the community. Conor, congratulations and welcome to the fray. I did a little air-punch when I saw that Conor had registered for election. Now Farset is getting an upgrade: replacing its most aged part with a new, faster, more functional one.</p>
<p>I have for years referred to myself as a &#8220;wannabe geek&#8221; to avoid anyone thinking that I actually know how to do anything technical. And, well, Conor&#8217;s one of those guys who does. But directing an experimental organisation like ours needs much more than tech credentials, and I think Conor brings the full set of tools to the table. He&#8217;s calm, friendly, organised (or at least he looks like he is because he&#8217;s always carrying a notebook!), and damn smart.</p>
<p>As Conor steps-up, I am stepping, well, kinda sideways. Quite a way actually. 8,341.14km in fact. I hope you will forgive my self-indulgence at taking this opportunity not only say hello to our new director, but also to offer some thoughts from a parting one. You know, like the private note the old president traditionally leaves for the new one&#8230; except it&#8217;s public. And not in the White House. And probably not as useful.<br />
<span id="more-1858"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4>Remember You&#8217;re a Director, not a Manager</h4>
<p>Your limited time in this life is priceless. Of every minute you can spare to help the cause, keep the long-term objectives in mind and try to steer this ship with nudges here and there. You&#8217;re aiming on an approximate course towards a bigger goal, rather than getting bogged-down by other people&#8217;s demands, little niggles, emptying bins, and all manner of bureaucratic chaff.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t forget the details. Sometimes they make all the difference.</p>
<p>A director, I think, should have a clear vision. I have my own idea of what Farset could and should be in future. Each of my colleagues on the team has a personal idea too. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap and no shortage of deviation. Conor, I invite you to design your own vision before you get spoiled by familiarity. Hold it close when things get messy.</p>
<h4>Reinforce The Positive</h4>
<p>When it comes to motivating people, it seems that the science stands in favour of reward over punishment. <a href="http://allpsych.com/psychology101/reinforcement.html">Positive reinforcement beats negative reinforcement</a>. So get behind those who help, shine a light on them. Incentivise and reward the pro-social, hold fast against the anti-social.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. And when something seems to work, it might have just been luck. Try to test and measure, try to understand the data. But in the end, you&#8217;ll never truly know what made the difference so don&#8217;t worry about it. When you look back <a href="http://irrco.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/why-punishment-is-better-than-praise/">the outcome was probably just Regression to the Mean</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, it&#8217;s nice to be nice.</p>
<h4>Nurture the Friendships</h4>
<p>Some high-flyers on the West Coast say that the worst thing you can do as a business founder is hire your friends. But those people will die lonely and disappointed in their overpriced homes. OK, so I&#8217;d concede that it makes sense to build a team of the best people possible and avoid nepotism on grounds of convenience or selfish aims. But I&#8217;d rather run into the unknown with people I can call in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some dear friends at Farset and now I can trust them to tell me when I&#8217;m being an idiot, without causing offence. Better still, I know they&#8217;ll cut me slack when my faults slow us down. Above all, I know I have their support, and they mine, if we go on to launch any more moonshots in the future.</p>
<h4>Hack Your Way</h4>
<p>We are constantly trying to figure-out how to make this work. Just when we get something nailed down, someone gets the bright idea to take it apart and turn it into something else. The processes, guidelines, lessons and resources, form a constantly shifting sea through which you can try to navigate but will never reach the other shore. There are best practices, not just from the global hacker/maker community (who will help if you ask them) but from wider industry and society. But sometimes you just have to deal with things when they happen. So hack the process. It&#8217;s a project in itself. And, like any good engineer, please do a better job than me at documenting your progress!</p>
<h4>And Lastly, Don&#8217;t Listen to Ben</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always advised people of this point, on which I feel quite strongly: people who have strong opinions and give confident advice probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The world is a strange, and strangely complex, complexly beautifully place. Running a venture that is novel, technologically &amp; creatively pioneering, and built on an eclectic, slightly anarchic crowd of fabulously smart and weird people, probably doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re all confident that Conor will be a great asset to the organisation and its members. He&#8217;s been on the Farset scene since it was just an idea so he knows the score. It will, I&#8217;m sure, take a little time to settle into a productive rhythm. Soon enough it will become clear where to be of most use. Everyone else will pick up the rest.</p>
<p>You know what Mitch Altman and the guys at <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">or for that matter Bill &amp; Ted</a>) would say: be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>Buena suerte Conor, y hasta luego todos mis amigos.</p>

<p>The launch day went, in our humble opinions, fantastically.</p>
<p>As in, really fantastic.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve met our targets and everything passed smoothly, but, far more importantly, we had an awful lot of fun.  A range of projects were attempted by those in the space over the 24-hr period, some of which were unexpected, all of which were cool. We can only mention a selection of the activities, but some of the most notable follow.</p>
<p>Andrew Sheppard learnt the ropes on an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> and got some guidance on some of the low-level aspects of microcontroller interfacing. He also went nuts with a labeller in the kitchen. Ben Bland and Conor Flanagan, among other things, did the necessary measurements and are well on the way to creating a <a href="http://www.blender.org/">3D model</a> of the building. Eoghan Murray and Conor Robinson set up an <a href="http://www.rsgb.org/">amateur radio station</a> in the Event Space, with an antenna running nearly the length of the building. It was <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/contents">illegal</a> for around two minutes when one non-licensed member decided to try and chat to someone. Sighs were heard all round. Then David Kane joined them and they went numbers station hunting, successfully tuning into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVB-76">UVB-76</a> from Russia on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2EKWgTNEYU">4625kHz</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the lounge, Niall Bole masterminded a gaming system with an Xbox 360 and projector that kept everyone entertained when they weren&#8217;t working. Likewise, the library and the vintage hardware were used both for amusement and for serious reference, with copies of <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/">Wired</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yourself-Electricity-Electronics-Fourth-Edition/dp/0071459332">Teach Yourself Electricity and Electronics</a> (Gibilisco), to name a couple, taken off the shelves and used. The ancient CRO was connected to&#8230;er&#8230;<em>something</em> that Conor Robinson built in the Event Space, with William Cully looking on, vaguely confused at the erratic waveform. The <a href="http://www.toshiba-europe.com/bv/computers/products/notebooks/portege620ct/index.shtm">Portege</a> laptop also disappeared with Chris Murray and was booted and explored.</p>
<p>The kitchen proved to be a good social hub, with people taking a break around coffee or a beer, leaving the gamers and their spectators at peace in the lounge, though cheers and lamentations could be heard constantly through the open door. We thought heating may be a problem (and had electric heaters at the ready), due to our lack of gas for the boiler at the minute, but attendance was so good that body heat (plus the heat from our servers) warmed the building comfortably.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was brilliant, with a party mood blended perfectly with a work ethos and several people mucked in to get the network infrastructure upgraded and humming along even faster than before. All of this was fuelled off snacks, soft drinks and some harder ones provided by Farset Labs, as well as a pizza order organised by the Prince of Pizza, Niall Bole. Rachel Gregg provided the most awesome cupcakes ever tasted by exhausted hackers, giving a taste of what the Bakerspace will be like.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t mention everyone of the 30+ people who came to the space and their projects, mainly because I (David) didn&#8217;t even get the time to go around them all, despite wanting to, but there was a wide variety of awesomeness being attempted.</p>
<p>The 24-hr event thinned out on the Saturday morning, but, after people got a few hours sleep, several members (and the directors) came back and worked in the space together, with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7F37BB1A67E0238D&amp;feature=plcp">Tron soundtrack</a> providing the backing music. It was great to see people eager to come back right away and everyone worked until around 10pm on the Saturday night. The space (at this time on a Sunday night) has six people currently in it&#8230;and we&#8217;re about to take a break and educate three of them in the wondrous series that is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Firefly</a></em>.</p>
<p>And so closes Farset Lab&#8217;s first weekend. We&#8217;re all wrecked, full of junk food and haven&#8217;t been seen by significant others in too long, but, damn, it was good.</p>
