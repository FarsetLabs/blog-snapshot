<p>This week&nbsp;Ben and Bolster were up on the hill for the launch of <a href="http://OpenDataNI.gov.uk">OpenDataNI</a>, with whom we&#8217;ll be working on a Hackathon in Early 2016. In other news, Dan has been working pretty much around the clock migrating, updating, and sane-ifying networking and ops for the space.</p>
<p>Coming up this week we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.cryptoparty.in/belfast">Cryptoparty</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday and the last&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/eli5-explain-like-im-5-registration-16105213126">ELi5</a>&nbsp;of 2015 on Thursday. Hopefully see you there!</p>

<td><b title="“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge. The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format. The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission. The rules for both groups are the same: Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A. No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations. Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name. The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her! Punishment for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère. If you’ve got something you’d like to share, email events@farsetlabs.org.uk to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5” See you there!">ELI5 [Event Space]</b></td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we&#8217;ll be publishing some of the interesting things that members have been up to over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This is totally inspired by the same mechanic developed at <a href="http://doesliverpool.com/category/weeknotes/">DoEsLiverpool</a>, and the code is open-sourced on my <a href="https://github.com/andrewbolster/pyweeknote-generator">GitHub</a>, and issues/bugreports/fixes are appreciated (I&#8217;ll eventually move it over to the <a href="http://www.github.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">Farset</a> collection, once it&#8217;s battle-tested!).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s intentionally minimal and I&#8217;ll be looking at adding more advanced functionality later, particularly &#8220;Most popular <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">FB</a> / <a href="http://www.twitter.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">Tweets</a> from Farset&#8221; and &#8220;Most popular Discourse Discussions&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not a designer so someone else can make it pretty.</p>

<td><b title="“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge. The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format. The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission. The rules for both groups are the same: Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A. No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations. Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name. The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her! Punishment for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère. If you’ve got something you’d like to share, email events@farsetlabs.org.uk to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5” See you there!">ELI5 [Event Space]</b></td>
