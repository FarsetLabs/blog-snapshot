<p><b>HOW DO I ENTER?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask that you <strong>reserve your seat at Farset Labs</strong> using our Meetup.com page at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Farset-Labs-Events/events/236020828/">meetup.com/Farset-Labs-Events</a> &#8211; entry is free for everyone!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam is always very popular; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is free, and all meals are catered!  The game jam’s theme will be announced at </span><b>5pm on Friday 20th January</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on.

<p><b>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam is a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the </span><a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games For Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement.  There are already a number of large </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 480 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since </span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/farset-labs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>As the nights close in during October, warm your creative engine with some tasty <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">Game Jam</a> at Farset Labs. Our friends at <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> will be returning for a day-long game jam on <strong>Saturday 18th October</strong>, with a panel of independent game developers judging the winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> is a games jam event to build, bind and encourage the gaming community to make their ideas happen. This latest Belfast date forms part of a chain of GameCraft events starting back in 2012 with 120 people producing more than 35 games at the first event; since then it has been hosted in Belfast, Dublin, London, New York, and at huge national games events like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28923671">Insomnia</a>.</p>
<p>The jam is based on a secret theme, announced on the Saturday morning.</p>
<p>With that as your starting point, no matter your particular interests or skills, the task of making a game in a single day begins.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to a game jam before can tell you about the excitement of getting started, and the satisfaction of getting to the end &#8211; in between are the half-baked ideas that just about work, the quarter-baked short-cuts that work better than they deserve to, and the ages of concentration to get an animation right because it makes the character &#8220;just perfect&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fun ride, and GameCraft concentrates all of this into one day, so there&#8217;s none of the crazy-sleepless-zombie-coding seen at weekend jams.</p>
<p>Come to have fun! Come to share ideas or just compete! Most of all, come and make games!</p>
<p><strong>This is a BYOC event</strong>, but Farset can provide external monitors on request.</p>
<p>You can find more information about GameCraft, and <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">register for GameCraft Belfast, on their site</a>. <strong>Registration is required</strong> to take part.</p>
<p>Farset Labs Members can also take advantage of their <strong>free tickets</strong>. <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/free-members-tickets-for-gamecraft/556" target="_blank">Information on how to get your free tickets in our members forum</a></p>

<p>This past month, we&#8217;ve been involved in <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/">DCAL&#8217;s</a> Creativity Month, in association with <a href="http://creativityni.org/">Creativity NI</a>.</p>
<p>This allowed us to experiment with ways to bring the general maker and creative community together, through our <a title="Makers’ Meetup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/makers-meetup/">Makers Meetup</a> programme (which we&#8217;ll be continuing as a basic social event), the <a title="Farset Bring &amp; Buy Sale" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-bring-buy-sale/">Bring and Buy sale</a> (that was decimated by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21955784">unprecedented weather</a>), and our upcoming <a title="DIY Guitar Pedal Workshop" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/diy-guitar-pedal-workshop/">DIY Guitar Pedal Workshop</a> (which still have spaces available if you order quickly! <strong><a href="http://www.maker.ie/farset-lab-fuzz-pedal-workshop.html">We have to close sales tomorrow</a></strong>!).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also been getting involved in other Creativity Month events; I went to <a href="http://www.blickstudios.org/">Blick Studios</a> <a href="http://www.creativecamp2013.com/">Creative Camp</a>. There was a fantastic array of speakers and activities (And Munchies!), and while I had to dart off soon after lunch (Due to our <a title="Club Mate Buy In" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/club-mate-buy-in/">Club Mate</a> arrival&#8230;), I was honoured to be speaking about our little lab.</p>
<p>As with most speaking events, the Q&amp;A is often more interesting than the speaking; one of the thrusts of my discussion was the siloed nature of Northern Ireland&#8217;s Creative and Technical Industries; Web Developers talk to Web Designers, Typographers talk to Graphic Artists, and Electronics-heads talk to Radio-heads, but rarely do these silos of talent and experience actually get pierced and mixed.</p>
<p>I suppose if there was an &#8216;aim&#8217; for Farset, from my perspective, it is to provide an even ground for these silos to interact on. Between our<a title="GOL4 – Back again" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gol4-back-again/"> Gathering of Lightning</a> member-driven speaker series to our varied range of <a title="Global Game Jam Roundup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-roundup/">hackathons</a>, we are trying to make people mix, because that&#8217;s where the best ideas come from; the intersection of two (or more) experience spaces.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1174" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1174" alt="Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP-225x3001.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1174" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical</figcaption></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s why I would implore you to get involved in what we&#8217;re trying to do. This isn&#8217;t about software or electronics or computers or gaming or whatever. This isn&#8217;t about making money; we&#8217;re all running on passion (and Caffeine!). This isn&#8217;t about stealing people&#8217;s ideas or scooping up equity. This isn&#8217;t about chasing funding at the expense of your ethics.</p>
<p>At its core it&#8217;s about sharing knowledge, experience, and inspiration across the full range of STEAM* areas for not just the &#8216;next generation&#8217; with our <a title="Coder Dojo @ Weavers Court" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/coder-dojo-weavers-court/">CoderDojo</a> and <a title="Outreach at Farset Labs" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/outreach-at-farset-labs/">Outreach</a> programmes, but also the current and past generations of industry leaders in the creative and technical arts.</p>
<p>Creativity Month was a risk for us to take on; we&#8217;re not an art house, we are a collective of the &#8220;Creative-Technically Minded&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t exactly make it easy to tick bureaucratic boxes and stay honest&#8230;</p>
<p>The act of creation and ideation is universal across art and science and engineering and business. Aspects from one area can complement and enhance others.</p>
<p>Only through mixing the melting pot of talent we have in this wee country do we have a hope of a prosperous, and happy, shared future. So please, get involved. <a title="Join Now" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Join the labs</a>, Come to an <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/org/2238451237?s=Style%20object">Event</a> or <a href="http://www.maker.ie/farset-lab-fuzz-pedal-workshop.html">Workshop</a>, or even just share this page to someone you think needs a bit of inspiration.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Science, Technology, Engineering/Entrepreneurship, Art and Mathematics</p>
