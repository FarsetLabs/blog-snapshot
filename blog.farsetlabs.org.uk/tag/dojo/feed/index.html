<p><strong><em>Farset Dojo is changing; we&#8217;re skipping December and moving from Eventbrite to Zen; restarting on the 8th of February, running every fortnight.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hello followers and supporters of Farset Dojo and awesome Guardians of the Ninjas.</p>



<p>We had planned to run our next event on Friday the 7th of December but have decided to postpone the Dojos until after the New Year! This is to allow the champions and mentors (and the ninjas!) to enjoy the holiday season with their families and friends. We&#8217;re also moving from EventBrite to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/home">Zen</a> (the global Coder Dojo website).</p>



<p>Zen has fantastic <a href="https://coderdojo.com/resources/">resources</a> available to ninjas and mentors, and it gives us a nice change when it comes to registering who will be attending.</p>



<p>Sign up to the new and shiny Farset Dojo <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo-belfast">here</a> if you want to attend any future events. We&#8217;ll be back to running <strong>every fortnight</strong> from Friday the 8th of February at 7pm!<br /></p>



<p>If you want to mentor you just need to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo">register</a> at Farset Dojo or email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re super excited to get back into it in February, and we look forward to starting an awesome year with the ninjas.</p>



<p>______________</p>



<p>Happy Holidays, from Zoe &amp; Andrew</p>



<p>xxxx<br /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farset Dojo is back&nbsp;<strong>this Friday</strong> from 6pm to 8pm, and will be continuing on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of the month until the end of August.<br />
<span id="more-2873"></span></p>
<p>As usual, if attendees can bring their own machines that&#8217;s extremely helpful, and as usual, we&#8217;ll be doing weird and wonderful, self-driven projects from electronics, programming, web/game design, interactive art, and (my personal favourite) conductive ink!</p>
<p>Spaces are limited so please don&#8217;t book too far ahead if you&#8217;re not sure you can attend.</p>
<p>Volunteers always welcome of course! If you&#8217;d like to help out, give us a shout on dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>
<p>See you all soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we sent out survey requests to anyone who&#8217;d attended (and registered) to our <a href="https://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/">CoderDojo</a> programme since day one.</p>
<p>This was so we could get a better handle on what we were doing well, and maybe not so well, and was also intended to answer one simple question; which day is better to run it. I&#8217;ll not be making any grand analysis yet as I believe the results tell their own story.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to add your thoughts, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q6J2WGZ">the poll is still open</a>, but we&#8217;ll be feeding these findings back into our plan going forward and will let you know any changes ASAP.</p>
<p><a href="https://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/">And don&#8217;t forget, the next dojo is next Friday</a></p>
<h1>What day of the week works best for you and your family to attend the Dojo in the evening</h1>
<p>We intentionally restricted the options in this question to Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday as Wednesday is already reserved for free for any usergroup that wants to hold an event, and Saturdays are too high value for hackathons and other events to block book.</p>
<p>[wp_charts title=&#8221;daychart&#8221; type=&#8221;bar&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width = &#8220;60%&#8221; datasets=&#8221;1,4,5,5,0&#8243; labels=&#8221;Mon,Tues,Thurs,Fri,Sun&#8221; scaleFontSize=&#8221;24&#8243; scaleOverride=&#8221;true&#8221; scaleSteps=&#8221;5&#8243; scaleStepWidth=&#8221;1&#8243; scaleStartValue=&#8221;0&#8243;]</p>

<h1>What did you like about the Dojos?</h1>
<ul>
<li>my son loves it, he is able to talk to people and ask questions that i can&#8217;t answer.</li>
<li>Great engagement between mentors and kids.</li>
<li>really well informed savvy help. , please take a sweetie from the tin.</li>
<li>Helpful mentors, creative learning.</li>
<li>Good range of topics and interested children</li>
<li>Nice friendly atmosphere with people actively offering their skills and knowledge</li>
<li>&lt;My son&gt; loved it, liked the support &amp; small group.</li>
<li>The informality and enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Great location</li>
<li>The very young age group.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What did you dislike about the Dojos?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency of delivery.</li>
<li>Disappointing range of mentors, lack of organisation</li>
<li>It can seem slightly disorganised at times</li>
<li>There is nothing that I dislike, and it is important that they continue. I am just more committed to the larger scale and structure of the BMC dojos.</li>
<li>We need a structured programme with lessons i.e. syllabus etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Would you like to say anything else about the Dojos? Good bad or ugly we want your feedback! Have the Dojo&#8217;s &#8220;changed&#8221;, if you went before, what stops you now? Anything, everything, we need your advice!</h1>
<ul>
<li>I think this is a great opportunity for young people to learn the language and skills associated with computer programming that can only help them in the future, although i fear some children under 14 will not be able to avil of this oppertunity because of the supervision rule, parents from areas of deprivation find it more difficult to take thier children to these places because of other family commitments etc</li>
<li>Seemed more controlled before the Summer.</li>
<li>I come in from the country. It would help to be able to pre-discuss and maybe book extra help time.</li>
<li>Would love to go back regularly but Friday PM is not a good time for us.</li>
<li>Small groups are great but have you thought about informing schools about it? You might be able to help more kids. Maybe also ni4kids? Very difficult for parents to find out about technology related clubs for kids, found out through a colleagues husband. Thought the mentors were lovely &amp; understanding of my sons needs.</li>
<li>Just keep reminding me of events at Farset. I need to get more stuff into my calendar.</li>
<li>Instructors have become less helpful over time.</li>
<li>Some from of progression for the kids.</li>
</ul>

<p>Farset Labs is playing host to the <a href="http://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.com/">Weavers Court CoderDojo</a>, kicking things off with a &#8216;soft launch&#8217; next Thursday the 21st from 17:30-20:00. With mentors (and kids) hopefully coming from all over the park and from the community of Sandy Row, we think that this will be a great addition to our <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php?title=Outreach_Projects">growing outreach activities</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be running the Dojo on the First and Third Thursday&#8217;s of the month (we know this makes for a strange end-of-May, but it&#8217;s the lesser of two evils&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p>
<p>At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.</p>
<p>CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.</p>
<p>It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don&#8217;t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there an age limit to enter the event?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> is aimed loosely at the under 18&#8217;s, but any child younger than 14 <strong>must</strong> be accompanied by a parent or guardian</p>
<p><strong>What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus</p>
<p><strong>What should I bring to the event?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that&#8217;d be great.</p>
<p><strong>I can&#8217;t make it, what can I do to help?</strong></p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at BMC in <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/110" target="_blank">Belfast</a>, <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/274" target="_blank">Ballymena</a>, or the brand new Dojo in <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/45" target="_blank">Newry</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.</p>
