<p>This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.</p>
<p>Since <em>before</em> day one, a 3D printer has been on the minds of the community (and plenty of people who have said that they would join the community if those facilities were available), and now, <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">we&#8217;re ready to rock</a>!<span id="more-698"></span></p>
<h1>&#8220;Hold on, what are you getting?&#8221;</h1>
<p>What we&#8217;re asking for is £2,000 for an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/ultimaker-kits.html">Ultimaker 3D Printer</a>, an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html">UltiController</a> (allowing members to print their plans directly from SD card), and several kilos of <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">ABS and PLA Plastic</a> to actually print, along with a rolling tool-table to keep all of the relevant parts in one &#8216;package&#8217; for easy use.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://blog.ultimaker.com/about/">Dutch</a> designed and manufactured kits can deposit 3mm diameter ABS or PLA plastic to an accuracy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0125+mm">12.5 micrometres</a>, in a potential build volume of over <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21x21x22+cm">2.5 gallons</a>, at a rate of a cubic centimetre every 7 seconds, at a rough cost of 4p/cm$^3$.</p>
<h1>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it just be bought outright?&#8221;</h1>
<p>Farset Labs serves a wide community with very disparate interests, from PS2 Clustering to Pinball repair. As such, it isn&#8217;t fair for the collective community to pay so much for one sector, especially if the interest in that sector is speculative. Beyond that argument, Farset Labs operates on a break-even basis at the minute and as such, simply can&#8217;t afford such a large investment at this time.</p>
<h1>&#8220;So what do I get for my hard earned donation?&#8221;</h1>
<p>There are nine donation reward levels, ranging from &#8216;Just feeling good about yourself&#8217; to a years Freelancer membership plus a choice between the intermediate reward levels. In between, the individual &#8216;swag&#8217; items on offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name on a Laser Etched Plaque on the machine</li>
<li>A 3D printed of the brand new Farset Labs logo</li>
<li>A 3D printed model of your choice, along with a timelapse video of your model being printed</li>
<li>Customised Farset Labs tee-shirt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> Kit and Personalised 3D printed Case</li>
<li>and Email and Video &#8220;Thank you&#8221; messages from the Directors</li>
</ul>
<h1>&#8220;But&#8230; But&#8230; But&#8230; I wanted 3D printing time?!&#8221;</h1>
<p>Ahh, but that&#8217;s the big story; 3D printing will be free for all membership levels and the consumable supplies will be taken out of the global community budget (once we run out of the specific 3D printer funds).</p>
<p>This freedom will be on a &#8216;fair use&#8217; basis; if you wish to do any larger scale manufacture, please <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">order</a> your own materials and feel free to use the printer here!</p>
<h1>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m sold, I&#8217;ll chuck a few quid in&#8221;</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw">Thank you!</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re running the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume</a> until Sunday the 18th of November, and hope to get your tasty tasty rewards out to you before Christmas, so please share this blog post to anyone who you think would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please let us know below or on the campaign.</p>

<h1>Project Management: 3D Printer</h1>
<p>If you want to get more involved in how the day to day operation of Farset Labs goes, including our upcoming fundraising for our 3D printer, swing over to our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine </a>to start making your mark, even if it is just reporting &#8216;bugs&#8217; with our current system.</p>
<h1><a title="FlackNite" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357">FlackNite</a>: 1400 19/05/2012</h1>
<h2>Internal Event: Members (Free), Day pass (£5)</h2>
<p>Flack (Farset Labs hACK) night is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events.</p>
<p>The challenge is simple; finish a technical project in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work.</p>
<p>Flack offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers. Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re up for it, start submitting your project ideas (or look for others to join up with) on our <a title="Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/a/ideafactory.do?id=17839&amp;mode=top&amp;discussionFilter=byids&amp;discussionID=28776" target="_blank">Ideascale</a>. If any specialist equipment or components are needed, also add them to the same &#8216;Flacknite the first&#8217; campaign.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re also looking for any talented Graphic Designers to put together a fancy pants logo for FlackNite. Please post any ideas or submissions publically on either the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">facebook page</a>, or our twitter @FarsetLabs</strong></p>
<h1>Bloc54: 1700 22/05/2012</h1>
<h2>External Event: Free</h2>
<p>The Bloc54 Games network are coming back to FL for their <a title="Digital Circle" href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/bloc54-games-network-may-meetup" target="_blank">May meeting</a>, welcome back guys. They will celebrating the release of couple more games and hopefully hearing more about games development support from InvestNI, but are welcoming visitors/walkins as well.</p>
<p>They will have 3 projectors up and running so be demo-ready!</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Demos including Zombiesaurus Games</li>
<li>Unity 3D demo</li>
<li>More in event comments</li>
</ul>
<h1>Embedded Workshop: TBC</h1>
<p>The Results (hopefully live)</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="800" src="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewanalytics?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ&amp;pli=1" width="320" height="240"></iframe></p>
<p>Make of that what you will.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be collating the results and making a decision as to the makeup and costing of the programme as soon as we get some free time (remember, volunteers with &#8216;day jobs&#8217;!)</p>
<p>If this is the first you&#8217;ve heard of this, refer back to our <a title="Planned Event: Embedded Programming; Fun with Boards" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/planned-event-embedded-programming-fun-with-boards/" target="_blank">previous post</a>!</p>

<p>Things have been moving fairly quickly (compared to the normal speed of Northern Irish progress), but it&#8217;s about time we made a public update.</p>
<p>Due to the practicalities of developing something like this, a lot of the day-to-day development of Farset Labs has been done with little publicity. This was to maintain clear communication within the launch-community and worked really well in fleshing out the ideas for the space, the community, and the projects involved.</p>
<p>Special thanks must go to the members of Queen&#8217;s University Engineering, Science and Technology Society (<a title="QUESTS" href="http://quests.society.qub.ac.uk">QUESTS</a>) for letting Farset Labs fly under their wing initially, and to <a title="Ben Bland" href="http://unblanked.com/" target="_blank">Ben Bland</a>, <a title="Eoghan Murray" href="http://twitter.com/#!/eoghanmurray" target="_blank">Eoghan Murray</a>, <a title="Matt Campbell" href="http://twitter.com/#!/just__matt" target="_blank">Matt Campbell</a>, and <a title="David Kane" href="http://www.davidkanecreative.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Kane</a>, who between them have been instrumental in getting this far.</p>
<p>Even beyond the &#8216;regular&#8217; group, there&#8217;s been a large amount of input from the community at large, through our <a title="Farset Labs Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">IdeaScale</a>, where you can vote on and submit ideas for the space, on everything from equipment purchasing to governance strategies.<span id="more-62"></span></p>
<h1>What&#8217;s been happening?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A significant amount of time was spent endeavouring to get local tech-business sponsorship for start-up<br />
costs and initial rental fees, but this quickly degraded into a multi-way chicken-and-egg scenario where potential sponsors wanted more plans in their preferential areas before they could commit, and we couldn&#8217;t commit since, frankly, none of us have the time or the money to mount a full-scale business proposal for something that is perfect for boot-strapping.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my <em>personal</em> belief that once we boot-strap ourselves into existence, corporate sponsors will come running to get involved in what will be the centre of the tech community in Belfast.

<h1>So how far are we anyway?</h1>

<p>Well we&#8217;re currently in final-stage negotiations with ex-Lord Mayor of Belfast, Tom Ekin, of <a title="Weavers Court Business Park" href="http://www.weaverscourt.com/" target="_blank">Weavers Court Business Park</a>, Just off Sandy Row in Belfast.</p>
<p>Weavers Court is a controlled industrial estate 3 minutes walk from Great Victoria Street Station, 15 minutes walk from Belfast City Centre, and 20 minutes walk  from UU York Street building and QUB Ashby Building.</p>
<p>Additionally, plenty of free car-parking spaces, an on site Cafe, and a whopping <a title="10gB Tibus Fibre Line" href="http://www.tibusconnect.com/about/news/item/14/super-speed-business-park-is-first-in-europe/" target="_blank">10Gb Tibus Fibre-line connection</a> with direct peering to the Hibernia Atlantic via Project Kelvin in Coleraine, giving <a title="Hibernia Atlantic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic" target="_blank">&lt;60ms latency to the Eastern Seaboard</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it a perfect location not only for the kind of technical experiments we plan on doing, but also for community outreach within both the local south-Belfast area, but also the entirety of Northern Ireland, being just two hours by train from Londonderry.</p>
<p>[fsg_gallery id=&#8221;1&#8243;]</p>
<p><strong>All being well, and pending review of the rental agreement with some associates, we should be moving in within the fortnight.</strong></p>
<h1>So What Can We Do?</h1>
<p>The space is more or less sorted, but it&#8217;s empty. We need your help to fill it while we wait for membership cashflow to buy more equipment.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard hackerspace stuff (check out the <a title="Hackerspace Electronics Lab" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Electronics_Lab" target="_blank">hackerspaces.org</a> page for examples),</li>
<li>general network and power infrastructure equipment,</li>
<li>DIY Tools and Materials,</li>
<li>Electronics tools</li>
<li>Embedded controllers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, mBed, PICAXE, etc)</li>
<li>Computers (any condition; dead ones will be turned into decorations; extremely old ones will  be turned into museum pieces)</li>
<li>Interesting tech-hardware (No, a printer doesn&#8217;t count, unless its a dot matrix <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/e189493b036abc631c15614a44070ed1.png" target="_blank">in which case&#8230;</a>)</li>
<li>Art/Decoration supplies, Paint, Brushes, rollers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything you can give, we&#8217;ll make it up to you when we get the Karma system up and running (blog post incoming about that; exciting times!)</p>
