										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has accomplished a lot in the past <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/01/what-is-farset-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 years</a>, stimulated by the goodwill of the STEAM community, and underpinned by the direct financial support of the membership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like many others in the community and voluntary sector, we face continually rising overheads despite efficiently delivering our charitable aims. As such, we’re exploring a new revenue stream: <strong>in-space advertising</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, we will be putting up four A3 poster panels in the co-working space and workshop on a three-month trial basis, available on rolling monthly hire by outside organisations and companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These poster locations will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis at the discretion of the Farset Labs management team, and posters must be provided by the advertiser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are currently priced as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community/charitable/non-profit groups advertising events, programmes &amp; opportunities: £150pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct advertisement of goods, services &amp; jobs: £300pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indirect promotion of recruitment services &amp; non-specific roles: £600pm</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d be interested in participating in this trial, contact us on <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of this three month period, the results and impact will be assessed openly in the community along with trial participants, and any modifications deemed necessary will be made before restarting the programme. Trial participants will have early-access into the continued programme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new revenue stream will give Farset Labs a more stable platform from which we can cover our increasing operational costs and focus on reinvesting in our services and facilities. We want to achieve this without having to put any more financial pressure on the members of our community who need access to these resources the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has been a fully membership-funded community space, delivering volunteer-driven <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2017/01/farset-dojo-2017-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outreach</a>, <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/free-workshop-for-secondary-teachers-introduction-to-bbc-microbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a>, and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/launching-makerassemblyni-16th-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facilitation</a> to the STEAM community; from programming &amp; engineering courses at local primary and secondary schools, to taking part in national and global collaborative events such as <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/12/global-game-jam-2017-20th-22nd-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Game Jam</a> and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/bbcmakeitdigital-connected-home-roadshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC’s Make It Digital </a>campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, we have been a melting pot for meetups and user-groups, with our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/how-to-start-a-class">free use of our event space on Wednesday evenings</a> for qualifying non-profit groups and individuals, where organisers can test the viability of their event ideas, developing communities that can (and usually do) rapidly grow to join the major meetup circuit beyond Farset Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the nature of the community fostered under our roof, Farset Labs has also hosted and spun-through a number of successful member-run startups, giving entrepreneurs the freedom to explore, collaborate, and experiment without losing equity or requiring significant upfront costs (<a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Desk rental</a> starts at £100 per month, but <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/hotdesk/">hot desking</a> is included at all membership levels).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this while operating on what can only be described as a &#8220;lean&#8221; budget. With no staff, no salaries, and no institutional funding, we have kept our significant outgoings limited to rent, power, heating (most of the time), cleaning and refuse collection, and insurance/accounting/<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/11/farset-labs-legal-encounter/">legal</a> fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, your company or your organisation wish to support the work of Farset Labs, or are interested in engaging with this unique community, get in touch via email to </span><a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tweet us at <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs">@FarsetLabs.</a></span></p>

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.</p>
<p>Since <em>before</em> day one, a 3D printer has been on the minds of the community (and plenty of people who have said that they would join the community if those facilities were available), and now, <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">we&#8217;re ready to rock</a>!<span id="more-698"></span></p>
<h1>&#8220;Hold on, what are you getting?&#8221;</h1>
<p>What we&#8217;re asking for is £2,000 for an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/ultimaker-kits.html">Ultimaker 3D Printer</a>, an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html">UltiController</a> (allowing members to print their plans directly from SD card), and several kilos of <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">ABS and PLA Plastic</a> to actually print, along with a rolling tool-table to keep all of the relevant parts in one &#8216;package&#8217; for easy use.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://blog.ultimaker.com/about/">Dutch</a> designed and manufactured kits can deposit 3mm diameter ABS or PLA plastic to an accuracy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0125+mm">12.5 micrometres</a>, in a potential build volume of over <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21x21x22+cm">2.5 gallons</a>, at a rate of a cubic centimetre every 7 seconds, at a rough cost of 4p/cm$^3$.</p>
<h1>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it just be bought outright?&#8221;</h1>
<p>Farset Labs serves a wide community with very disparate interests, from PS2 Clustering to Pinball repair. As such, it isn&#8217;t fair for the collective community to pay so much for one sector, especially if the interest in that sector is speculative. Beyond that argument, Farset Labs operates on a break-even basis at the minute and as such, simply can&#8217;t afford such a large investment at this time.</p>
<h1>&#8220;So what do I get for my hard earned donation?&#8221;</h1>
<p>There are nine donation reward levels, ranging from &#8216;Just feeling good about yourself&#8217; to a years Freelancer membership plus a choice between the intermediate reward levels. In between, the individual &#8216;swag&#8217; items on offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name on a Laser Etched Plaque on the machine</li>
<li>A 3D printed of the brand new Farset Labs logo</li>
<li>A 3D printed model of your choice, along with a timelapse video of your model being printed</li>
<li>Customised Farset Labs tee-shirt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> Kit and Personalised 3D printed Case</li>
<li>and Email and Video &#8220;Thank you&#8221; messages from the Directors</li>
</ul>
<h1>&#8220;But&#8230; But&#8230; But&#8230; I wanted 3D printing time?!&#8221;</h1>
<p>Ahh, but that&#8217;s the big story; 3D printing will be free for all membership levels and the consumable supplies will be taken out of the global community budget (once we run out of the specific 3D printer funds).</p>
<p>This freedom will be on a &#8216;fair use&#8217; basis; if you wish to do any larger scale manufacture, please <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">order</a> your own materials and feel free to use the printer here!</p>
<h1>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m sold, I&#8217;ll chuck a few quid in&#8221;</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw">Thank you!</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re running the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume</a> until Sunday the 18th of November, and hope to get your tasty tasty rewards out to you before Christmas, so please share this blog post to anyone who you think would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please let us know below or on the campaign.</p>
