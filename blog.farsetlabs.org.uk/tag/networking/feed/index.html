										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<h2>The Time:</h2>
<p>Thursday 3rd March @ 1830 for a 1900 start</p>
<h2>The Place:</h2>
<p>Farset Labs, Event Space</p>
<h2>The Theme:</h2>
<p>This year we&#8217;re trying something a little different; the invited speakers all have something vaguely to do with a common theme. This time, the theme is <strong>&#8220;Connections&#8221;</strong>. Free-for-all speakers are welcome to either stick to the same thing or do something completely unconnected (see what we did there?)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have one of the <a href="http://www.brewbot.io/" target="_blank">BrewBot</a> folks talking about how their connecting their hardware to their customers (mostly talking about embedded electronics platforms and cloud stuff, funzies), an occupational therapist from the NHS who&#8217;s embarking on putting together a collection of modular, 3D printable end-point prosthetics for people who have lost extremities (fingers, etc rather than limbs) talking about how these are physically connected back to the patients and how the patients brains reconnect to accommodate the fake-finger.<br />
We&#8217;ll also have someone from <a href="https://www.tibus.com/" target="_blank">Tibus</a> talking about the fibre-heartland of Belfast, discussing the technological connections at various stages, from the network within Farset and the fibre infrastructure across the business park, to the transatlantic connections that power <a href="http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/business/investinginbelfast/superconnected-belfast/superconnected-vouchersscheme.aspx" target="_blank">superconnected</a>businesses. Also someone from <a href="http://www.younginfluencers.org/" target="_blank">Young Influencers</a> talking about the social connections within and between NI tech/dev/design communities and the future of this community.</p>
<h2>The Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission.</p>
<h2>The Rules:</h2>
<p>The rules for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!</li>
<li>Punishment for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RupertWhitehead/posts"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2043" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RupertWhitehead312.jpg" alt="RupertWhitehead312" width="350" height="350" /></a>We&#8217;re pleased to announce that next Wednesday 21st Jan, we&#8217;re hosting <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RupertWhitehead/posts" target="_blank">Rupert Whitehead</a>, Developer Relations Regional lead at Google, responsible for the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, for an evening of discussion and collaboration around Google&#8217;s ecosystem of products.</p>
<p>Rupert runs the <a href="https://developers.google.com/groups/" target="_blank">Google Developer Groups</a>, Launchpads, <a href="https://developers.google.com/startups/" target="_blank">Startup Launch</a> and<a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/" target="_blank"> Google Developer Experts</a> programs in the region. His main focus is to help developers and startups become more successful with Google&#8217;s APIs. Prior to Google Rupert worked at Nokia and Symbian. He is a member of the <a href="http://www.cim.co.uk/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>With such an amazing speaker coming through the area to engage and grow the Google Developer Network in the province, and thanks to a serendipitous introduction by <a href="https://twitter.com/grib">Grib</a> at our Weavers Court neighbours, <a href="http://www.purpleguerrilla.com/">Purple Guerrilla</a>, we&#8217;re pulling an old trick out of the closet&#8230; The concept is simple. Pitch Per Square Foot.</p>
<p>We have approx 30 square meters of blackboard. About 322 sqft in old money. We guestimate that about 250 of that is usable by the average human.</p>
<p>Each attendee has a little over a square foot to describe themselves, make an impact, and leave enough contact details to be got in touch with.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-640" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg" alt="gilchrist2" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gilchrist2-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>That’s the gimmick. The real draw is the community. As we’ve grown, Farset Labs has developed an amazing community of technologists and business leaders (often in the same body). We want to provide the ultimate relaxed ‘networking’ environment where no one person can bogart the floor with their confidence, or the quiet one gets ignored.Everyone has a square foot*. Going over the lines will be punished by having your square wiped out and given to someone else. Inter-square war will be treated similarly, unless its really funny, in which case, we’ll allow it.</p>
<p>We used this process <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/" target="_blank">very successfully</a> over a year and a half ago and I&#8217;m glad we can use it again.</p>
<p>After everyone has started to get to know each other, Rupert will be talking about his work at Google, covering a huge range of topics from the evolution of Web APIs and building UX ecosystems through to Wearables and new form factors.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;ll be an opportunity for all attendees to discuss their ideas and maybe come up with some brilliant solutions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some say that he was once in a joint <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA" target="_blank">AMA</a> with <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/" target="_blank">Chuck Norris,</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIZU8cQWXc" target="_blank">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bc0WjTT0Ps" target="_blank">The Most Interesting Man In The World</a>, and still got the most questions.</p>
<p>All we know is, he&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Gilchrist_LLP" target="_blank">Martin Gilchrist</a>.</p>
<p>Martin is a regular user of the space and always has some hairbrained idea to try out and bash against the wall to see what sticks, and one day, he came to us with an idea for an informal networking event based around our georgous <a title="Paint It Black: This Weeks Updates" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/paint-it-black-this-weeks-updates/">blackboard</a>, which after some discussion developed into what we&#8217;re calling &#8216;Blackboard Tuesdays&#8217;</p>
<p>The Concept is simple. Intro Per Square Foot.<img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-617" title="blackboard" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/blackboard1.png" alt="" width="384" height="240" /><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>We have approx 30 square meters of blackboard. About 322 sqft in old money. We guestimate that about 250 of that is usable by the average human. We also have a <a href="http://youtu.be/HQDVYJGSHQI?hd=1" target="_blank">high definition camera</a> mounted in the ceiling that captures most of that blackboard.</p>
<p>Each attendee has a little over a square foot to describe themselves, make an impact, and leave enough contact details to be got in touch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the gimmick. The real draw is the community. As we&#8217;ve grown, Farset Labs has developed an amazing community of technologists and business leaders (often in the same body). We want to provide the ultimate relaxed &#8216;networking&#8217; environment where no one person can bogart the floor with their confidence, or the quiet one gets ignored.Everyone has a square foot*. Going over the lines will be punished by having your square wiped out and given to someone else. Inter-square war will be treated similarly, unless its really funny, in which case, we&#8217;ll allow it.</p>
<div class="inpostbox">
<h3>Vital Info</h3>
<p><strong>When: </strong><em>1600-1800 </em>Tuesday 04/09/12<br />
<strong>Event Links:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/266733133426586/">Facebook Event</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/blackboard-tuesdays-gilchrist-co">Digital Circle Event</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blackboardtuesdays-gilchrist.eventbrite.co.uk/">Eventbrite</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Our operational plan is to have an invited compere for each (hopefully monthly) session who will be the judge, jury and executioner for such infractions, and since it was mostly his idea, we&#8217;ve asked Martin to do the honours for our inaugural event.</p>
<p>Conveniently enough, our timing on this event corresponds with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/266733133426586/">Martin and Michelle&#8217;s fifth anniversary as Gilchrist &amp; Co</a>, so we&#8217;re letting him run rampant with branding.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d be interested in compering the next Blackboard Event, or sponsoring this or any future Farset Labs events, get in touch at <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk?subject=Blackboard%20Tuesdays" target="_blank">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p>*Approx, no-ones perfect, see diagram.</p>
