<p>Bring something tasty (or at least edible) and enjoy an evening with friends at Farset Labs.<br /><br /><em>Tip 1: Easy-to-share party foods and drinks are often the simplest, but if you&#8217;d like to show off a speciality dish it&#8217;s even better!</em><br /><br /><em>Tip 2: Microwave, fridge, freezer and a hotplate are available on the day.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>4 years old!  Farset&#8217;s now old enough to count and ride a tricycle.  Exciting times!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to have a bit of a party, and Farset Labs invite you to come and celebrate with us on Saturday 9th April from 7pm &#8211; as a thank you for staying engaged, involved, and nurturing local creative and technology endeavours.</p>
<p>Please do invite friends and well-wishers.</p>
<p>As well as being a general &#8220;Open/Social Evening&#8221;, we will of course have cake, party food and tasting sessions of local beverages and liqueurs, plus a selection of high-tech (low-commitment) games and multiplayer video-games, with plenty of opportunities to experiment with some of our projects and tools and meet-up with the community as we continue to grow.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing your wonderful face!</p>
<p>You are also welcome to BYOB, and your own 4th puns, as always <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Entry is free for Farset Members (including corporatesponsor employees) and £3 for non-Members.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll plumb the <strong>depths and ages of multiplayer game greatness</strong>, we&#8217;re open to playing anything suggested &#8211; so if you have any recommendations, let us know.  It&#8217;s best if it&#8217;s either available for all players to get easily, or if it&#8217;s a popular game.</p>

<p>This is a BYOPC and BYOB event. We have some machines available on site, but we recommend bringing your own machine if you want a well-performing rig <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>With my imminent departure for Nicaragua looming, I have the immense honour of welcoming Conor Robinson as our new incoming director, having been voted-in by the community. Conor, congratulations and welcome to the fray. I did a little air-punch when I saw that Conor had registered for election. Now Farset is getting an upgrade: replacing its most aged part with a new, faster, more functional one.</p>
<p>I have for years referred to myself as a &#8220;wannabe geek&#8221; to avoid anyone thinking that I actually know how to do anything technical. And, well, Conor&#8217;s one of those guys who does. But directing an experimental organisation like ours needs much more than tech credentials, and I think Conor brings the full set of tools to the table. He&#8217;s calm, friendly, organised (or at least he looks like he is because he&#8217;s always carrying a notebook!), and damn smart.</p>
<p>As Conor steps-up, I am stepping, well, kinda sideways. Quite a way actually. 8,341.14km in fact. I hope you will forgive my self-indulgence at taking this opportunity not only say hello to our new director, but also to offer some thoughts from a parting one. You know, like the private note the old president traditionally leaves for the new one&#8230; except it&#8217;s public. And not in the White House. And probably not as useful.<br />
<span id="more-1858"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4>Remember You&#8217;re a Director, not a Manager</h4>
<p>Your limited time in this life is priceless. Of every minute you can spare to help the cause, keep the long-term objectives in mind and try to steer this ship with nudges here and there. You&#8217;re aiming on an approximate course towards a bigger goal, rather than getting bogged-down by other people&#8217;s demands, little niggles, emptying bins, and all manner of bureaucratic chaff.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t forget the details. Sometimes they make all the difference.</p>
<p>A director, I think, should have a clear vision. I have my own idea of what Farset could and should be in future. Each of my colleagues on the team has a personal idea too. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap and no shortage of deviation. Conor, I invite you to design your own vision before you get spoiled by familiarity. Hold it close when things get messy.</p>
<h4>Reinforce The Positive</h4>
<p>When it comes to motivating people, it seems that the science stands in favour of reward over punishment. <a href="http://allpsych.com/psychology101/reinforcement.html">Positive reinforcement beats negative reinforcement</a>. So get behind those who help, shine a light on them. Incentivise and reward the pro-social, hold fast against the anti-social.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. And when something seems to work, it might have just been luck. Try to test and measure, try to understand the data. But in the end, you&#8217;ll never truly know what made the difference so don&#8217;t worry about it. When you look back <a href="http://irrco.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/why-punishment-is-better-than-praise/">the outcome was probably just Regression to the Mean</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, it&#8217;s nice to be nice.</p>
<h4>Nurture the Friendships</h4>
<p>Some high-flyers on the West Coast say that the worst thing you can do as a business founder is hire your friends. But those people will die lonely and disappointed in their overpriced homes. OK, so I&#8217;d concede that it makes sense to build a team of the best people possible and avoid nepotism on grounds of convenience or selfish aims. But I&#8217;d rather run into the unknown with people I can call in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some dear friends at Farset and now I can trust them to tell me when I&#8217;m being an idiot, without causing offence. Better still, I know they&#8217;ll cut me slack when my faults slow us down. Above all, I know I have their support, and they mine, if we go on to launch any more moonshots in the future.</p>
<h4>Hack Your Way</h4>
<p>We are constantly trying to figure-out how to make this work. Just when we get something nailed down, someone gets the bright idea to take it apart and turn it into something else. The processes, guidelines, lessons and resources, form a constantly shifting sea through which you can try to navigate but will never reach the other shore. There are best practices, not just from the global hacker/maker community (who will help if you ask them) but from wider industry and society. But sometimes you just have to deal with things when they happen. So hack the process. It&#8217;s a project in itself. And, like any good engineer, please do a better job than me at documenting your progress!</p>
<h4>And Lastly, Don&#8217;t Listen to Ben</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always advised people of this point, on which I feel quite strongly: people who have strong opinions and give confident advice probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The world is a strange, and strangely complex, complexly beautifully place. Running a venture that is novel, technologically &amp; creatively pioneering, and built on an eclectic, slightly anarchic crowd of fabulously smart and weird people, probably doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re all confident that Conor will be a great asset to the organisation and its members. He&#8217;s been on the Farset scene since it was just an idea so he knows the score. It will, I&#8217;m sure, take a little time to settle into a productive rhythm. Soon enough it will become clear where to be of most use. Everyone else will pick up the rest.</p>
<p>You know what Mitch Altman and the guys at <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">or for that matter Bill &amp; Ted</a>) would say: be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>Buena suerte Conor, y hasta luego todos mis amigos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summer can be either be downtime or uptime for kids, families and businesspeople alike. For our members who volunteer to run <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> at <a>Farset Labs</a> it could have been a good time to chill out. But noooooo, they&#8217;ve only gone and made more work for themselves.</p>
<p>This July and August, bring your kids to Farset Labs to learn their choice of the following, in four weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and program a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313">LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot</a>. The robot was part of the kit kindly donated to Farset by the <a href="http://nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre</a> for just this kind of hands-on learning. Well, it&#8217;s not just about the learning, right? It&#8217;s the errr&#8230;. Robots! <strong>UPDATE: LEGO sessions were booked-out in a couple of hours! Sorry. Hannah is taking names for more LEGO sessions in September, just email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></strong></li>
<li>Design a working computer game with <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>.</li>
<li>Design and build a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal CoderDojo will resume in September. See the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html">calendar for details</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand, while we have your attention, it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone that Farset has no public funding and is run by volunteers. No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/FL_DjSummer">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here</a>.</p>
<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer. I stayed up to the wee hours putting that abomination together. It&#8217;s MY abomination and I&#8217;m proud of it.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To relax and get to know the faces behind all the great and weird hackery that&#8217;s going on in the space and thanks to Glenn for being awesome and kicking this off, we&#8217;ll be having <strong>a full day of PC gaming</strong> on 19th April 12:00 to late &#8211; all welcome! Entry is free for Farset Members (including corporatesponsor employees) and £5 for non-Members.</p>
<p>We shall plumb the <strong>depths of multiplayer game greatness</strong>, while we&#8217;re open to playing anything suggested the prime recommendations for our first foray are RTS/FPS hybrids:</p>

<p>Get ready to <strong>team up and compete for map dominance</strong> all while having a blast and meeting new faces. Or have a break and kick back in the Farset Retro Gaming Lounge with some 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit (and 64bit?) console classics.</p>
<p><span id="more-1582"></span></p>
<p>There will be discounted dinner vittles ordered in specially, with snacks and drinks available throughout the day (in return for a donation to the charity). This is a BYOPC event, there will be some machines available on site, but we recommend bringing your own gaming rig if at all possible.</p>

We&#8217;ve been bashing our heads together with the Intel guys/gals and we&#8217;ve decided in celebration of Farset Labs being a whole 2 years old in April we&#8217;ll be hosting a 24 hour hackathon on Friday 4th April, theming it around their new <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/galileo/galileo-overview.html">Galileo boards</a>.<span id="more-1531"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s a Galileo?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1544" alt="intel_galileo-590x330" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/intel_galileo-590x330-300x1671.jpg" width="300" height="167" />The Galileo development board, is a Linux based microcontroller that’s compatible with <a href="http://hothardware.com/Tags/arduino.aspx" target="_blank">Arduino</a> software and shields and uses the new <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Demos-14nm-Broadwell-Processor-Worlds-First-22nm-Smartphone-and-Unveils-Quark-X1000-SoC-Open-Architecture-at-IDF13/" target="_blank">Quark X1000 SoC</a> processor (400MHz, 32-bit, Pentium-class, single- core and thread) that <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Demos-14nm-Broadwell-Processor-Worlds-First-22nm-Smartphone-and-Unveils-Quark-X1000-SoC-Open-Architecture-at-IDF13/" target="_blank">Intel announced at the IDF 2013 keynote</a>. Galileo is just 10cm x 7cm (although ports protrude a bit beyond that), and there are four screw holes for secure mounting. Ports include 10/100 <a id="KonaLink1" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">Ethernet</span></a>, USB client/host ports, RS-232 UART and 3.5mm jack, mini <a href="http://hothardware.com/Tags/pcie.aspx" target="_blank">PCIe</a> slot (with USB 2.0 host support); other features include 8MB Legacy SPI Flash for firmware storage, 512KB embedded SRAM, 256MB <a id="KonaLink2" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">DRAM</span></a>, 11KB EEPROM programmed via the EEPROM library, and support for an extra 32GB of storage using a <a id="KonaLink3" href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Launches-Galileo-Arduino-Compatible-Board-With-New-Quark-X1000-SoC/#"><span style="color: blue;">microSD</span></a> card.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Friday 4th April 18:00 &#8211; Saturday 5th April 18:00</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Farset+Labs/@54.5928524,-5.9400343,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x486108f686ba0491:0xf206df9d70d81d76" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> in our recently refurbished event space. To fuel the hacking we&#8217;ll be providing breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>Each team taking part in the Galileo section of the event is given a <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/galileo/galileo-overview.html" target="_blank">board</a> to develop on (which each team can fight over to take home!). Then everyone gets access to the Lab&#8217;s toy box of peripherals, components, prototyping equipment and tools to build something inspiring / cool / insane / useful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the event each team will be able to present the result of their hackery and our super savvy judging team will award a yet-to-be-decided prize to the best project.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you don&#8217;t want to compete and just want to hack on other projects that&#8217;s cool too. The rest of <a title="Who We Are" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/about-farset/" target="_blank">Farset&#8217;s Facilities</a> will be still open to experimentation and fiddling as usual.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As if anyone needs a reason to hack. Just in case &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s our <a title="Still Alive" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/still-alive/">second</a> birthday,</li>
<li>Intel have come aboard as a <a title="Please Welcome Intel to the Farset Family" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/please-welcome-intel-to-the-farset-family/">corporate member </a></li>
<li>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a> was still floating around he&#8217;d have been 450 in April.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s a limited number of spaces available so all attendees must preregister on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/galileo-hack-farset-labs-intel-hackathon-tickets-10922745225">Eventbrite</a>, the sooner you register the sooner you can save a seat and start forming your A-Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Intel have launched an instance on their recently acquired hacker league platform for us, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">sign up here</a>. In order to take part in the Galileo competition you must set up or join a project team on HackerLeague with &#8220;Galileo&#8221; in the name. Even if you have no idea what you&#8217;re going to do with it yet, we need to control the number of Galileo teams somehow and prizes may be awarded for the best name!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re particularly excited about this one, the space has been going through a lot of changes (ahem <em>upgrades</em>) and it&#8217;ll be great to get back to what we do best; hacking around with a bunch of great kit to play with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone </strong>planning to attend <strong>must</strong> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/galileo-hack-farset-labs-intel-hackathon-tickets-10922745225">register on the Eventbrite</a></li>
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> attending <strong>can</strong> <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">register on the Hacker League</a> to join or set up teams or projects</li>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> who wants to play with the Galileo and enter the competitions <strong>must</strong> <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">register on the Hacker League</a> <strong>and </strong>create or join a project with &#8220;Galileo&#8221; in the name</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Hacking</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1502" alt="Intel &amp; Farset Logos" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos-300x1281.png" width="300" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to publicly announcee our new corporate member&#8230; [drum roll]&#8230; <a href="http://intel.ie">Intel</a>. Welcome to the family!</p>
<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world’s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.</p>
<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel’s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.</p>
<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said “Intel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.”</p>
<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company’s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014. Any suggestions would be very welcome – what would you like to do with Intel?</p>
<p><em>This and the launch of <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">GGJ14</a> are part of this months <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Farset_Jan_News_Pack.zip" target="_blank">Press Pack</a></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that Farset Labs will be hosting a hackathon on the weekend of the <strong>7th and 8th of December</strong>*. The event, sponsored by Liberty IT, will be held in the newly renovated Event Space in Farset.</p>
<p>The hackathon brings together like-minded, creative thinkers with their most innovative ideas. You’ll be given the weekend to work on an idea you’d like to kick-start, taking advantage of a community’s knowledge sharing, as well as equipment and resources provided by Farset. And of course, there will be plenty of food and caffeine in supply to keep your energy levels up throughout the weekend!</p>
<p>To get a feel for how we run hackathons, have a look at some of our previous ones! <a title="Global Game Jam Roundup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-roundup/">Global Game Jam</a> was extra special, but our usual <a title="New Year Lightning – Flacknite – Raspberry Jam" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/new-year-lightning-flacknite-raspberry-jam/">Flacknites</a> are a good demo of the &#8216;hands off&#8217; approach we take.</p>
<p>This year the hackathon has the feel-good theme of “<strong>Making a Difference in the Community</strong>”, so chosen ideas should ultimately be for a good cause and benefit the local community in some way. That coupled with the chance to win a <strong>prize fund of up to £1000</strong> for the most innovative ideas; there are no better reasons to sign up!</p>
