										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1622" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/13703923935_2b9a4c287a_b-300x2001.jpg" alt="13703923935_2b9a4c287a_b" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Last weekend we celebrated Farset Labs&#8217; second birthday, and the arrival of our newest corporate member Intel, in traditional fashion: we threw a hackathon. Intel brought down a bunch of their new <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html">Galileo boards</a>, a huge selection of components and the ever-necessary beer and snacks.</p>
<p>With the ingredients in place for some serious hacking, we kicked-off with Intel&#8217;s Mark Corkery giving a quick talk on the company and their focus on developing the <em>internet of things, </em>spurring the teams to get stuck into figuring these boards out.</p>
<p>As expected with such a new piece of kit, much of the initial few hours was spent working out how to use the thing. A round of applause was deservedly given to Team Magee shortly before 11pm when they announced they&#8217;d not only connected the board to the internet but also got SSH into it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1638 alignright" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled-1-300x2711.jpg" alt="Untitled-1" width="198" height="179" /></p>
<p>Working through the night the teams uncovered a <a href="http://ccc.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/en/news/40">Yocto image from Intel Taiwan</a> which contained many useful pieces of software precompiled and suddenly the capabilities of the board increased exponentially.</p>
<p>However lady fate saw things going a little too swimmingly and suddenly our Ultimaker 3D printer decided to put a thorn in the competing teams plans by refusing to print. Team Magee were especially hard hit as their project required bespoke valves designed using 3D modelling software.</p>
<p><span id="more-1616"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1619 alignleft" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/13703983245_a726496fde_b-300x2001.jpg" alt="13703983245_a726496fde_b" width="243" height="162" /></p>
<p>After a shout out on our social media channels a member came to the rescue and the design was printed, albeit too late to be integrated into their hack.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone had a great weekend and we&#8217;d like to thank the guys at Intel for introducing themselves with a bang. Several new project ideas came out of it and we can&#8217;t wait to get started on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Projects</h2>
<h5>Team Magee: Hardware</h5>
<p>Team Magee designed a machine that allowed customers to order drinks via <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. The hardware team attached a Galileo to a pump, some piping and taps, so four individual bottles could be pressurised. The system brought liquid from the bottles and out the tap on demand. We&#8217;re hoping to see the team back in the space soon to taste test some of their cocktails!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/morph/13704011625/"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1620 aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3778/13704011625_1a5b64583a.jpg" alt="13704011625_1a5b64583a_b" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<h5>Team Magee: Software</h5>
<p>The software team worked on setting-up a Galileo to read the <a href="https://twitter.com/GalileoDrink">bot&#8217;s Twitter stream</a> and send commands to the hardware depending on the input. During judging they showcased the scary amount of hidden data put out alongside tweets and talked about how they could use this information in future iterations of their hack.</p>
<h5>Seek and Discomfort</h5>
<p>If there was a prize for most ambitious project it would&#8217;ve gone to this one. Seek &amp; Discomfort aimed to create an autonomous drone using the Galileo and write software such that you could play a game of hide and seek with your scary robot friend. As expected most of the night was spent playing with the AR Drone (who can blame them?) but they&#8217;ve promised they&#8217;ll get around to hacking sometime soon.</p>
<h5>Cloak of Many Colours</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright" style="line-height: 1.5em;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5118/13703970643_c083ce3252.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="120" />Resident hacker Robin hoped to further his prototype ping pong table, that lights up in response to acoustic vibrations from the ball hitting the table. He planned to adapt it into a stage costume. Unfortunately the components included in the board meant it wasn&#8217;t completely suitable but we sure had <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">fun looking at the pretty colours!</span></p>
<h5>Galileo Gamepad</h5>
<p>Rob Ellis arrived on the last day but impressively managed to use a joystick shield to create a galileo gamepad and used this as a means of controlling a character in his<a href="http://ammacentre.org/blog/?p=1602"> award winning game. </a></p>
<h5>Rotating Galileo Camera</h5>
<p>Andrew hoped to use the Galileo to control a camera mounted on a robotic arm. Unfortunately his genius became too widely known and he spent most of his time helping out other teams! He did manage to get <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> to compile on the board, an achievement in itself.</p>
<h5>Other</h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2837/13703645993_671f7a9051.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="128" />There were some non-Galileo hacks too. We welcomed Bolster back for the weekend, arriving more beard than man. He got stuck into working on the new Farset website and member resources with the help of Ben. Chris also put the finishing touches to our new member management system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was great to see so many awesome projects and enthusiastic hackers. We never know how these things will go or what will come out of them, but time after time we&#8217;re amazed by the crazy stuff people come up with. Next time, no matter what skills or background you have, leave your preconceptions at the door and join us&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Friday 4th April 18:00 &#8211; Saturday 5th April 18:00</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Farset+Labs/@54.5928524,-5.9400343,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x486108f686ba0491:0xf206df9d70d81d76" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> in our recently refurbished event space. To fuel the hacking we&#8217;ll be providing breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>Each team taking part in the Galileo section of the event is given a <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/galileo/galileo-overview.html" target="_blank">board</a> to develop on (which each team can fight over to take home!). Then everyone gets access to the Lab&#8217;s toy box of peripherals, components, prototyping equipment and tools to build something inspiring / cool / insane / useful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the event each team will be able to present the result of their hackery and our super savvy judging team will award a yet-to-be-decided prize to the best project.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you don&#8217;t want to compete and just want to hack on other projects that&#8217;s cool too. The rest of <a title="Who We Are" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/about-farset/" target="_blank">Farset&#8217;s Facilities</a> will be still open to experimentation and fiddling as usual.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As if anyone needs a reason to hack. Just in case &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s our <a title="Still Alive" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/still-alive/">second</a> birthday,</li>
<li>Intel have come aboard as a <a title="Please Welcome Intel to the Farset Family" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/please-welcome-intel-to-the-farset-family/">corporate member </a></li>
<li>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a> was still floating around he&#8217;d have been 450 in April.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s a limited number of spaces available so all attendees must preregister on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/galileo-hack-farset-labs-intel-hackathon-tickets-10922745225">Eventbrite</a>, the sooner you register the sooner you can save a seat and start forming your A-Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Intel have launched an instance on their recently acquired hacker league platform for us, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-galileo-hackathon-farset-labs">sign up here</a>. In order to take part in the Galileo competition you must set up or join a project team on HackerLeague with &#8220;Galileo&#8221; in the name. Even if you have no idea what you&#8217;re going to do with it yet, we need to control the number of Galileo teams somehow and prizes may be awarded for the best name!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re particularly excited about this one, the space has been going through a lot of changes (ahem <em>upgrades</em>) and it&#8217;ll be great to get back to what we do best; hacking around with a bunch of great kit to play with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to publicly announcee our new corporate member&#8230; [drum roll]&#8230; <a href="http://intel.ie">Intel</a>. Welcome to the family!</p>
<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world’s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.</p>
<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel’s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.</p>
<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said “Intel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.”</p>
<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company’s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014. Any suggestions would be very welcome – what would you like to do with Intel?</p>
