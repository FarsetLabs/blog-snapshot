										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/director-vote-2015/823">Voting is now open</a>; if you haven&#8217;t recieved an email and think you should have, or can&#8217;t access the poll, contact membership@farsetlabs.org.uk to double check your membership status.</strong></p>
<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pip Shea</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2613 size-medium" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg" alt="pip_s" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Farset Labs is extra_ordinary. It breaks the mould and defies the &#8216;wisdom&#8217; of incumbent structures through community building and collaboration. It offers an alternative for those of us who lurk in various guises on the creative technology spectrum: a place where we can practice, with autonomy, among an inspired and diverse community. I would like to become a director to help sustain this special space, and to contribute to its emergent practices and identity.</p>
<p>I have been a member since early 2014, and for the last couple of years I have been researching hacker/maker culture. I have a good understanding of the practices of Farset and how it is situated in a broader global context.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to offer my energy to the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>technology education and kids</li>
<li>measuring social impact</li>
<li>funding for social technology projects</li>
<li>participatory governance and ethics</li>
<li>membership drives</li>
<li>sharing Farset’s stories (its projects and practices) with the wider world</li>
<li>getting a laser cutter!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to become more involved in Farset Labs as I am passionate about grassroots making. During the 2000s &#8211; in Australia &#8211; I worked in <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/community-development/">community development</a> as an artist, producer, and manager on projects that focused on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/networked/">net art</a>, aerosol art, and large-scale outdoor <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/projection/">projections</a>. In 2010, I turned my hand to research to investigate <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133">ethical internet practices in the community arts field</a>. I then worked as a research assistant at various universities in various incarnations. My research broadly explores digital cultures and philosophies of technology. I’m currently writing <a href="https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/PipShea">two book chapters</a> about maker culture, and assembling a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/crafting_making_hacking_research">hacking/making/crafting bibliography</a> on Zotero.</p>
<p>Other projects on the boil include: designing interactive tools with the QUB School of Psychology; editing an open access journal; and, making an art project that explores block chains and distributed databases through geometry. Ongoing interests include: <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Appropriate_technology">appropriate technology</a>, <a href="http://conceptlab.com/criticalmaking">critical making</a>, and <a href="http://www.foodphreaking.com/issue0pdf/Food_Phreaking.pdf">food phreaking</a>.</p>
<p>If you feel you need a little more info about me, it can be found at <a href="http://www.pipshea.net">pipshea.net</a></p>
<p>Cheers!</p></blockquote>
