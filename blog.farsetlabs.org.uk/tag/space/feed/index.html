										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After going through due process, the desk usage policy has been updated to: explicitly state that un-rented desks should be cleared after use; that members have the right to move equipment left on un-rented desks to communal storage areas; which desks are currently rented/hot-desk/communal; and implementing standard COSHH practices.<span id="more-2931"></span></p>
<p>Here at Farset Labs, we started off with a relatively simple, if comprehensive, sets of <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">Rules, Policies, and Codes of Conduct</a>, covering the use of the space, equipment in the space, and the guidelines that we as a community agree to abide to.</p>
<p>99% of these can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the space better than you found it.</li>
<li>Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sometimes it becomes necessary to be a little more explicit about the expectations of the wider community. Two issues that have been raised with the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/">management and director teams</a> occasionally but persistently since day one is &#8220;someone left a desk covered in junk, what do?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this desk rented?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://farsetlabs.slack.com/archives/C03G2CK5J/p1527063330000063">Around May time</a>, discussions in the Slack boiled up to a point where the Directorship and Management teams realised that for about a year we&#8217;d been discussing a &#8220;Clear Desk Policy&#8221; that we were absolutely sure we definitely, definitely, had one that said &#8220;clear up your stuff when your done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oops.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>So, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koEeVoujnw3RIsW0fy_TxjXLvebNwtC0V7OWSbBGKZY/edit#heading=h.ljhyi1zcfx4r">June Town Hall</a>, I raised <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Gbpx3m7K2IdUzjPjvuPLP4QbLGaG3riKGkQPGybypQ/edit#slide=id.p">a proposal</a> to address a few simultaneous issues around &#8216;where should be clear, who should clear it, and where can I put stuff?&#8217;. This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.</p>
<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling. We have since day one had an explicit exclusion on firearms/ammunition , explosives, Offensive weapons, Unlicensed radio equipment, large quantities of combustibles, inflammables, or pressurised gases, stolen equipment, or banned substances. However, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed from the <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/f90919fa0711f5e816a2f2252912d0bbd8ab4860#diff-d39a174faa68201faf0c6caaf6c912ba">old rules</a>, &#8216;large quantities&#8217; was never defined, so naturally we eventually got a couple of reports of members effectively bulk buying both high end solvents and pressurised containers on the cheap, and stashing them in boxes somewhere&#8230; So David Kane and Colin Kelsey took on the task in writing up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8u9mFUWM5no0mWuirTc53Zq5wBjiHrlaIC0Z-wNEOQ/edit">their own proposal</a> to expand and extend the coverage of our COSHH policies, that was similarly unanimously ratified at the June Town Hall.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of behind the scenes process; that doesn&#8217;t mean in &#8216;Farset Land&#8217; that the new rules came in to force; just that the community had agreed in principal to the rough outlines; the proposal still needed to be turned in to the actual changes required in the Rules, Policy&#8217;s and Codes of Conduct to bring them up to speed with the proposal; if it&#8217;s not <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">on the website</a> it&#8217;s not a real rule.</p>
<p>Since moving our website to <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/tree/21817e4c38c251fa5149f7cc8574e0322c8757f0">Github hosted Markdown in 2013</a>, any changes to &#8216;the rules&#8217; have been recorded and mostly Pull-Request/Reviewed as part of the ratification process in order to be as open as possible. We&#8217;re not always perfect at this but we&#8217;re getting better about being as transparent and open as possible and not just rushing through rule changes without consultation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/165">COSHH pull request</a> was relatively simple to review and merge as it was mostly technical and &#8216;edge case&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/164">Desk Rental pull request</a> was a bit more complex, with members of the community collaborating and beating out the policy changes to cover any edge cases, and was signed off on at last nights&#8217; Town Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant&#8221; changes in this policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently-Rented Hot-Desks, are indicated as in red on the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">Facilities page</a>, and it is the responsibility of the Directors and NEMs to keep this up to date.</li>
<li>Any desks labeled in green in the facilities diagram are available for Rental</li>
<li>All Green and Blue desks are subject to a clear desk policy, which means these desks must be cleared of all equipment (on or under) before leaving the space</li>
<li>Any equipment left unattended at such desks can be moved by any member to common storage facilities.</li>
<li>Two desks in the workshop are being opened up to being rented.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to thank the members who made it out last week to blitz and &#8220;defrag&#8221; the whole space; it&#8217;s survived a week without turning back in to a tip which is always a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="VID 20180730 WA0003 2" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQMmesROYK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s a little notification/story from the governance of Farset; as a reminder, Town Halls are held on the first Monday of the month in the Event Space at 7pm and are open to both members and interested-non members (however non-members can&#8217;t vote). A lot of Farsets&#8217; day-to-day governance <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">is handled in our Slack</a>, which, again, is open to both members and non-members.</p>
<p>If there are any questions or ideas about how governance is handled, we&#8217;re more than happy for those to be discussed publicly on Github or Slack, or privately by emailing info@farsetlabs.org.uk, or admin@farsetlabs.org.uk if there is something sensitive to be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_612" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-612" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rrl-armadillo-rocket-ship-1008b1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-612" title="Space API" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rrl-armadillo-rocket-ship-1008b1.jpg" alt="Its Accessing Space, That's Punny!... Stop looking at me like that..." width="400" height="615" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-612" class="wp-caption-text">Accessing (the) Space</figcaption></figure>
<p>The SpaceAPI was <a href="https://hackerspaces.nl/spaceapi/ ">born</a> in the Netherlands, and now lives on <a href="https://github.com/SpaceApi">github</a>. As the name would indicate, it provides an API abstraction layer to a physical (hacker)space.</p>
<p>It <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/spaceapi/space/">exposes</a> information such as:<br />
* Open/Closed State<br />
* Location<br />
* Webcam Feeds<br />
* Contact Details<br />
* Sensor data</p>
<p>and more, from a simple <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> API.</p>
<p>The Farset Labs SpaceAPI server was built to solve the problem of multiple occupancy on the K8055 interface board, that had been the centre of the space&#8217;s <a href="http://www.andrewbolster.info/blog/2012/04/k8055-usb-python-twitter-irc-space-indicator-as-a-os-service/">open/closed notification system</a>.</p>
<p>This system, internally called on differentoccasions Farbot, or Titania, communicated over <a href="http://twitter.com/farsetlabs">Twitter</a> and <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/farsetlabs" target="_blank">IRC</a> as well as exposing a SpaceAPI<a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/spaceapi/space/" target="_blank"> json responder</a> for any  enabled services, the <a href="http://hackerspaces.me">Global Hackerspace Wall</a> being a perfect example</p>
<p>When it was decided to integrate the door control from the planned Access Control System into the same service, it quickly became clear that Titania was getting too big and too ugly, and it would be beneficial to decompose the problem into different application.</p>
<p>But these applications wouldn&#8217;t be able to talk to the <a href="http://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?country=be&amp;lang=en&amp;id=351346">k8055</a> at the same time, so there would have to be ANOTHER application sitting on top of the board, providing a unified API access point.<span id="more-610"></span></p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The Farset Labs Space API is built on top of the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> micro-framework, and using a customised version of the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/31/">authdigest</a> plugin to provide for persistent file-based authentication database.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/FarsetLabs/SpaceAPI">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Not only have we produced the api service (running on <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/spaceapi">farbot.unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk</a>), but there is also a simple python <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/SpaceAPI/blob/master/SpaceAPIClient.py">client</a> libary that can be used to play with the service from anywhere in the world. If you find any bugs, <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/SpaceAPI/issues">please let us know</a>!</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>As it stands at the minute, the SpaceAPI <strong>can</strong> control access to the space, and <strong>can</strong> open the space for an authenticated user, so we <strong>are</strong> on track to roll out our intended &#8220;Out Of Hours Members Access&#8221;, but we have some other teathing problems to deal with, specifically settling on a Member CRM and Backend Authentication system, as well as rejigging the Network infrastructure, implementing secure wifi / VPN, and a load of other plans for members to take advantage of.</p>
<p>But the directors do this as a hobby, and as such can&#8217;t dedicate all their time to building these tools. The community needs to help. And if you have any skills in web dev, secure networking, graphic design, DBA, or associated, please get in touch with your ideas on how we can make the place even more awesome than it already is.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spacefed.net/wiki/index.php/SpaceFED">Interspace Federated Auth system</a> &#8211; Where we&#8217;re heading</li>
<li>Intro and spec of <a href="http://hackerspaces.nl/spaceapi/">SpaceApi</a></li>

For a while, we&#8217;ve been playing with the idea of getting rid of the suspended fibre ceiling in the space and exposing the period pillars and beams, and after a day&#8217;s experimentation, it&#8217;s decided: we&#8217;re going ahead!</p>
<p>What the vision entails is exposing the entirety of the building&#8217;s original woodwork and support pillars, and restoring them to their former glory. New architectural lighting, black ceiling beams and renovated cable management are all in the master plan, as well as some lovely aesthetic improvements like stripping the cast iron pillars to the bare metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-538" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px 6px;" title="2012-06-12 13.28.03" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.03-150x1501.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>However, we&#8217;ll need some assistance.</strong></p>
<p>We currently do not have many sets of <strong>ladders</strong> which are a crucial part of the project. Limited timescale and funds mean that the ceiling needs to be finished very promptly, so all help possible is appreciated.</p>
<p>We would greatly appreciate anyone who would be willing to help out or<strong> lend us some stepladders</strong> for the duration of the project; without your help it will be much harder to restore the Old Schoolhouse to its former glory!</p>
<p>If you would like to <strong>help out in any way</strong>, or would be willing to lend us some equipment, materials, or their time, please get in contact through the usual channels.</p>

<p>Thank you very much to everyone who has offered to donate equipment to Farset Labs &#8211; we&#8217;re very grateful, as members&#8217; generosity is what has allowed us to start.</p>
<p>However, none of it is in the space yet, so we&#8217;d like to let you know that today (Wednesday 4th April), Farset Labs will be open for the dropping off of equipment from 11am to 6pm.</p>
<p>If you need something bulky picked up, we can send out reinforcements equipped with a trailer and if these times don&#8217;t suit you, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in contact (david@farsetlabs.org.uk or eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk) to arrange a more convenient slot.</p>
<p>We advise that you give us a heads up before you come round to Farset Labs, as we may be away for short periods doing pick-ups of bulky items, but we&#8217;ll do our best to have someone around to let people in.</p>
<p>If you would like to add your equipment to the list of donations, we&#8217;d be very grateful. To do so, fill out our short donation form at <a title="Donate to Farset" href="http://bit.ly/donatetofarset" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/donatetofarset</a></p>
