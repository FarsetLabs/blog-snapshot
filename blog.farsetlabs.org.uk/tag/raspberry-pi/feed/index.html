										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Friday (2nd) at 17:30, the Dojo is back.</p>
<h3>Info for Kids/Parents</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" rel="nofollow">CoderDojo</a> is a movement orientated around running not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p>
<p>At CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more.  In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and as well as developing key critical thinking and problem solving skills. It&#8217;s also a lot of fun!</p>
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;"><iframe src="//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=18085833214&amp;ref=etckt" width="100%" height="306" frameborder="0" marginwidth="5" marginheight="5" scrolling="auto"></iframe></p>

</div>
<p>We&#8217;ve also pre-booked between now and Christmas, at which point we&#8217;ll be taking a small break and will be relaunching in January. Those dates are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Info for Mentors</h3>
<p>Thanks to our recent &#8220;mentor drive&#8221;, we&#8217;ve got lots of new volunteers to help out with running this great programme. (<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-outreach-201516-call-for-mentors/" target="_blank">There&#8217;s always room for more!</a>)</p>
<p>As part of this new wave of mentors, we&#8217;re hosting an induction session this <strong>Wednesday</strong> between 17:30 and 19:30, sneaking in before the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GDGBelfast/" target="_blank">Google Developer Group</a> Meetup (although we can break out into the workshop if discussion continues).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re running late / can&#8217;t make it, but it&#8217;d be helpful if you could let outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk know if you&#8217;re no longer interested and we&#8217;ll take you off the mailing list.</p>
<p>This discussion will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introductions / Networking (&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m $NAME, ask me about $SKILLS, don&#8217;t ask me about $FEARS&#8221;)</li>
<li>Child Protection Policies / Emergency procedures</li>
<li>Worksheet / Equipment / Resource overviews</li>
<li>Communication preferences</li>
<li>Open forum for &#8220;cool things we should do&#8221;</li>
</ul>

</strong><br />
After a long summer hiatus, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> is relaunching at Farset Labs, under old management on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214" target="_blank">Friday the 2nd of October from 17:30 to 19:30</a>. We&#8217;re also unveiling separate FarsetDojo <a href="http://twitter.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> pages where we&#8217;ll be sharing what goes on, so give them a Follow and a Like to keep up to date with the latest Dojo happenings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=18085833214" alt="Eventbrite - Farset Labs CoderDojo" /></a></p>
<p>But this post isn&#8217;t (just) about that. Farset Labs was built around the idea of exploration and giving back to the wider community, presenting opportunities that people wouldn&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to.</p>
<p>Over the past three and a half years, we&#8217;ve helped so many people, young and not so young, engage with technology in a much more human way, and we do that on the strength of our mentors.</p>
<p>And basically, <strong>we need you</strong>!</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in helping out with <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>, or just want to put your name down on the &#8220;call out&#8221; list for our outreach events, please take two minutes and fill in the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/AiTPyxICVB" target="_blank">form</a> below. Your contact information will be private and you will only be contacted for relevant outreach activities.</p>
<p>Also you don&#8217;t have to be a Farset Labs <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/index.html" target="_blank">Member</a> to be a Mentor (but it always helps!), and if you&#8217;ve got any questions about Farset&#8217;s outreach programmes, give us a shout on <a href="mailto:outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Farset Labs &amp; <a href="http://culturetech.co" target="_blank">CultureTECH</a> are hosting a <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> at the Nerve Centre, Derry-Londonderry on Saturday, March 28th, 1pm-5pm as part of <a href="http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/festival/creativity-month" target="_blank">Creativity Month</a>!</strong></p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use.</p>
<p>While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fsl-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800.jpg" alt="raspberryjam_800" width="800" height="533" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />This session is suitable for kids of all ages, and no previous knowledge is required. You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along.</p>
<p><em>The event is FREE to attend but spaces are very limited so please only book if you can attend and no more than 2 spaces per booking. Thanks!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>We have some great news on the Raspberry Jam front in Northern Ireland! We&#8217;re planning to make our <a title="Return of Raspberry Jam" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/return-of-raspberry-jam/">Raspberry Jams</a> at Farset Labs a lot more frequent (instead of the current roughly every 6 months). We are looking into once a month or bimonthly.</p>
<p>Before we start though doing more frequent Raspberry Jams we want to grab some feedback from you, even if you have never attended a Raspberry Jam before.</p>
<p>Previous events have covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting Started with your Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Hardware interfacing for Scratch using <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>, <a href="http://cymplecy.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/scratch-gpio-version-2-introduction-for-beginners/">Scratch GPIO</a> and <a href="http://piborg.org/ledborg">LEDBorgs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> on your Pi</li>
<li>Building complex animations with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></li>
<li>And lots of sharing of individual projects like Bangor Academy&#8217;s <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/2013/01/25/pi-cade-project-team-at-bangor-academy/">PiCade</a>, a <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/?p=97">Lego PiBot</a>, some great Scratch games, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to figure out what you want to learn, what type of things you would like to see at a Raspberry Jam (Talks, Q&amp;As, hands on workshops etc).</p>
<p>So please take a few minutes to go through our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cr3AptTeKW7jGHnNc_yOdNTMiLkglObZunwhIzrCf0A/viewform" target="_blank">really quick anonymous survey</a>, you have the chance to give your opinion on what we do at the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams for the next few months!</p>
<p>We hope to announce the date of the first in the new series of Raspberry Jams within the next few days so keep an eye on the Farset labs blog and social media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest project  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>

<p><strong>Date &#8211; 16th November</strong><br />
<strong>Time &#8211; 1pm to 5pm</strong><br />
<strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet regularly to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one. We may even have a few spare you can use on the day.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi with flashy lights and ScratchGPIO</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are very welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have an awesome pi project you have been working on, we would love you to bring it along and show it off in the show and tell.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>THIS EVENT IS IN HIGH DEMAND SO PLEASE BOOK AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT</strong></div>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The date is 22/7, or <em>Pi Approximation Day</em>, so it’s a good day to announce Northern Ireland&#8217;s very own charitable space programme, and start work on sending a Raspberry Pi into space. We&#8217;ve picked this project deliberately because it will require people with a wide range of skills and interests to collaborate, hopefully uniting our technology community&#8230; and because SPACE.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SpacePi_0021.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SpacePi_002-300x2401.jpg" alt="SpacePi_002" width="500" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1328" /></a></p>
<p>The plan is to attach a Raspberry Pi to a weather balloon and track its progress as it travels into the stratosphere and, hopefully, returns safely to Earth. Photos, videos and measurements will be taken on the journey, and for the next few weeks it&#8217;s open season on any crazy stunts people want the craft to perform while it&#8217;s up there. &#8220;There&#8221; being SPACE.</p>
<p>This kind of thing has been done before, typically using a smartphone for GPS and GoPro for video, so we&#8217;re going to have to make use of the Pi&#8217;s computing power to do something unique. This might as well be a world-first, no point aiming lower.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/28307809" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32572222" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>The thinking behind this is that we have this community of geeks who are all keen to build things together, the trouble is choosing what projects to get stuck into. So we&#8217;ve proposed a challenge that needs the collaboration of loads of people from different backgrounds – electronics, mechanics, software, communications, legal &amp; admin, all sorts. It&#8217;s something everyone could contribute to.</p>
<p>We met yesterday to assign teams to cover each of the main disciplines that will be required (Mechanical, Electrical, Management, and Marketing/PR). The teams are seeking help, not just from Farset Labs members but anyone who is keen to support the project. Details such as the launch date and the craft&#8217;s functions are open for discussion for the time-being and all ideas are welcome, within reason. Already some suggestions have been assigned to the bin, mostly because they&#8217;ve involved live animals or explosives – or both.</p>
<p>Notes from the first meeting are in GDocs, <a title="Farset Labs SpacePi First Meeting" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wd7pbxAEwfdytjUinWikYlAZJ0Pe2CIjYuxnOnYsXbw/edit" target="_blank">here</a>. More details soon. For the meantime, err, SPACE.</p>
