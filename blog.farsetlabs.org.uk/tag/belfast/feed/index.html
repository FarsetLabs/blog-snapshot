<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Global Game Jam is back in the building to kick-off the new year!</strong><br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">Register your seat now!</a></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>&nbsp;at Farset Labs is back again in 2020, with support from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/" target="_blank">Northern Ireland Screen</a>. The Game Jam will run <strong>from Friday 31st January to Sunday 2nd February</strong> &#8211; come meet some great people and develop a game idea in a weekend. With a party atmosphere from Friday night, there will be plenty of people there to team up with, create something interesting and (most importantly) to have fun!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>



<p>A global simultaneous&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hackathon&nbsp;</a>making games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as table-top board- and card-games. Some will be just for fun, others for charitable causes like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games For Change</a>, and none of them exist before this weekend!</p>



<p><strong>Farset Labs</strong> has been running Northern Ireland’s largest regular public GGJ site since&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank">2013</a>, this year joining over 100 other countries taking part. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the weekend, and there will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam listing</a>.</p>



<p><strong>HOW DO I ENTER?</strong></p>



<p>We ask that you <strong>reserve your seat</strong> at Farset Labs <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">on Eventbrite</a>, so that we can get accurate numbers for our food orders (included in your registration).</p>



<p>You can then complete your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam registration</a>&nbsp;on or <strong>before Friday 31st January</strong>.</p>



<p>Global Game Jam is always very popular; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</p>



<p>Registration this year is <strong>£5.99 per person</strong> &#8211; registration will reserve your seat for the weekend as well as helping us to provide you with catered meals for the full weekend and unique GGJ Belfast goodies!</p>



<p>The theme is announced on-site at <strong>5pm on Friday 31st January</strong> so we recommend everyone be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on. We look forward to seeing you all, as it will be a great weekend!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>



<p>There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>



<p><em>Please note:</em>&nbsp;<strong>You must be over 18</strong> on the 31st of January to participate.</p>



<p>More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact&nbsp;<a href="http://mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>&nbsp;or ask us questions via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter&nbsp;</a>with the&nbsp;<strong>#farsetggj20</strong>&nbsp;hashtag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farset has been one of the organisations working on this project for a while and it&#8217;s <strong>now time to open it up fully to our community</strong> &#8211; we&#8217;re all really looking forward to seeing what emerges from the hack night. The aim of the project is to <strong>develop a system to, among other things, capture and analyse user data</strong>. The system will be rolled out across many different charities in Belfast and will be the cornerstone of reablement provision in the city for the years to come, so this is a brilliant chance to get involved.</p>
<p>Reablement (a concept arising out of the DHSSPSNI Transforming your Care Strategy*) <strong>helps people to get back to normality after illness or an accident</strong>, providing support such as ensuring the person has access to transport, or working with them as they relearn skills lost while unwell. The University of Ulster, in association with a group of charities led by Bryson Charitable Group, is developing a system to allow charities to enhance their provision of reablement services in Belfast as well as streamline their record keeping.</p>
<p>Farset Labs is hosting <strong>an evening of hacking on Friday 27th September from 1700 until late</strong> &#8211; food and drinks will be provided. The purpose of the event is to <strong>develop ideas</strong> for the overall system, with a particular emphasis on how the information will be input and handled. We welcome <strong>all abilities</strong> &#8211; from those who only wish to produce wireframe layouts and flowcharts to those who are capable of coding a working mockup of a portion of the system within the timeframe. Members of the UU team will be on hand, as will several representatives from the charity.</p>
<p>There will be a <strong>companion event ONE WEEK EARLIER on Friday 20th September from 1830 to 1900</strong> where we&#8217;ll hold a &#8216;<strong>briefing</strong>&#8216; session, taking care of any questions you might have, which should mean that, come the 27th, everyone will be able to get straight into the hackathon. If you can&#8217;t make it to the briefing, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; we&#8217;ll make a <strong>summary available online</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an excellent opportunity to help out the third sector in Belfast and get involved in the cutting edge of community healthcare, so please join in, whether you&#8217;re a coder, designer or just generally want to lend a hand!</p>
<p><strong>Preparatory briefing session: Friday 20th September &#8211; 1830 to 1900</strong><br />
<strong> Hack-evening: Friday 27th September &#8211; 1700 to late &#8211; refreshments provided</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as we count down to our Steampunk-themed birthday party this weekend (<a href="http://fsl-industrial-revelations.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Tickets still available btw</a>), we were approached to host one of the more esoteric events of the calendar; a Steampunk LARP.</p>
<p>LARP stands for Live Action Role Playing, and can be summarised as a cross between a costume party and an immersive acting improvisation session, with a dash of D&amp;D thrown in, usually involving either historical, fantastical, or &#8216;alternate histories&#8217; scenarios playing out with a cast of costumed characters imagining themselves in the part.</p>
<p>So on September 28th, we&#8217;ll be playing host to&#8230;</p>
<h1><span style="font-family: georgia,serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oedUTOL.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" style="width: 400px; height: 280px; float: right;" alt="Belfast in 1880 with some modifications" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oedUTOL.jpg" /></a>Steel and Water</strong></span></span></h1>
<p>It&#8217;s 1882 and Belfast sits proudly as the de facto capital of The Federated Northern Isles. Its docks bustle with trade from Scandinavia, Russia, the Americas and North Africa and the populace thrives within the established social classes of Tin, Brass, Silver and Gold. Boasting the worlds first subterranean, submarine public transit system and home to some of the worlds grandest and finest engineering Belfast is the very model of a modern city. However, civilisation and endeavour always come at a price and must always face trials; alongside glorious and novel developments come novelties that are darker and less palatable.</p>
<p>Steel and Water is an immersion roleplay experience in which you become your steampunk persona and face the challenges of an advanced and alternative Belfast.</p>
<p>Booking coming soon, updates here and on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/370148599762982/">Facebook group for Steel and Water</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/larpni/events/steel-and-water---world">Read more about the world of Steel and Water</a></p>
<p><a href="http://steelandwater.brownpapertickets.com/">Tickets cost £15 per player and include a hot meal and refreshments. </a></p>
<p>Character Generation is coming soon, and will be available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/larpni/home">LARPNI website</a> and emailed to all ticket holders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s over, and it&#8217;s a new world record. Farset Labs has contributed to the <a title="Media Assets" href="http://globalgamejam.org/status">Worlds Largest Game Jam</a>, and everyone involved should be very proud of what they&#8217;ve accomplished in just 48 hours.</p>
<p>With 30 registered <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2013/farset-labs/jammers" target="_blank">Jammers</a>, 11 registered games (6 made it to submission, but that&#8217;s ok!), no-one can say that Northern Ireland doesn&#8217;t have the making of a solid creative industries foundation.</p>
<p>With people coming from all walks of life, experience, platforms, and passions, self-organized teams came together to work on what are major accomplishments, with a tight timescale and a vague theme (a heartbeat).</p>
<p>The games themselves ranged from platformers where your heart-rate is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the level, to location based assassination, built purely around the sound of a heartbeat (Murmur In The Park), or the brilliant game that had the theme slightly shoe-horned in, but a kinda 4-player bastardisation of QWOP (CardiRow) for rowers where two players team up to drive the two oars of a boat, against another two player in their own boat, where cooperation, communication, and coordination is required to beat the other team without blowing your heart out! There was also Heart Wars where two players competed to collect pieces of virus or cure to kill or save a patient, and Cardiac Castle which used an iPhone Camera to monitor the players heartrate, making the zombies chasing their avatar move faster as the player got more panicked!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an amazing experience, not just because of the attendees; we had the awesome Brendan Drain from <a href="http://indiegamehq.com/screenshot/predestination-by-brain-and-nerd/" target="_blank">Brain and Nerd</a> call in over Skype to chat to the jammers, and discuss their game mechanics, future marketing possibilities, and generally having the craic, and we&#8217;ve had the wonderfully patient Niall Bole from our friends at QUB <a href="http://www.dragonslayers.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dragonslayers</a> in working on configuring the <a href="http://www.ultimaker.com/" target="_blank">Ultimaker</a> perfectly. (After we recover from this weekend, we&#8217;ll be getting peoples rewards out as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Lessons to the reader; sell tickets, don&#8217;t give them away. We had to turn away people asking for tickets towards the end because we had already over-allocated the space. In the end we only had a 68% turnout on the first night, dropping to the 30 / 50 that we ended up with on the second night. This mis-calculating effected our budgeting, scheduling, catering, and lots of other -ings, and while we try to be as inclusive as possible, in future events we will be adding a nominal fee for non-members, just to gauge a certain level of commitment so we can more efficiently spend ours and event sponsors money on the people who really want to be involved in what we&#8217;re doing here at Farset. Members will still be free though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting fairly close to collapsing so I&#8217;m going to leave you with some snaps from the weekend, including our lovely 3D Printed Logo. I&#8217;ll close with a special thanks to the<a href="http://www.ulster.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> University of Ulster</a> for kindly sponsoring this amazing event, and to <a href="http://www.tibusconnect.com/" target="_blank">Tibus</a> for giving us more bandwidth than you could shake a stick at, and <a href="http://wimps.tv/profile/30" target="_blank">Davy Sims</a> for the lend of more chairs, because we were still very slightly over subscribed&#8230;.</p>
