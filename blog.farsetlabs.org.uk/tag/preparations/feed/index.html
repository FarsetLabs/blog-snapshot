										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-186" title="The Store" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-02-18.21.47-300x1791.jpg" alt="Equipment in the store" width="300" height="179" />Another day of frantic work and continuous driving has brought us much closer to our launch tomorrow. The plumbers have completely fitted the toilets to a great standard and the electricians are making sense of the circuits around the building; the puzzle pieces that were outside our control have pretty much fallen into place. After a long day driving to collect tables, hoovering endless dust and generally cleaning up, we&#8217;re about to pack up for the night, exhausted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve fitted out the reception area with a little more server equipment and a slightly fancier network configuration, and have the water supply turned on, making the space a lot more pleasant to be in. The contractors are finishing up and our outer window frames received a welcome coat of paint. Windows were scraped and the equipment store was further populated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, final preparations include the plumbers and electricians finishing up, the hopeful delivery of our electric cooker, preparations for the rooms and general last-minute cleaning.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see you all at our <a title="Launch Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191615090954138/">launch event</a> tomorrow at 3pm!</p>
