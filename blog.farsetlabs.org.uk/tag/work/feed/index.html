										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">UPDATED</span>:&nbsp;</strong></em><em>The original letters sent to Farset Labs have been linked to throughout the article for context and transparency. Further questions will be answered via email at admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs has gone from strength to strength since opening its doors in April of this year, and the community has grown and matured quickly, but our summer progress was slower than was hoped for. Our entire model and ethos is built on transparency and democracy, so we publish this document to explain to our membership and supporters the difficulties placed in our path due to litigation launched by Latens/Pace plc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of the blue, on the 14th June, multiple copies of <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Letter-to-Farset-Labs-14th-June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> were hand delivered to Farset Labs by Pinsent Masons, legal representatives of Latens/Pace, as well as emailed to several different accounts of the Directors whether they were Farset Labs related or personal, work and university inboxes. One of our members had been accused on their last day of work of stealing sensitive Confidential Information from their employer and transmitting it to Farset Labs. The letter explained that we had possession of their property, and that it it was on our equipment. It demanded that we exclude an allegedly-involved member from the premises and cut all communication with him pending completion of their investigations. Two of the Directors have known the member for almost a decade, having gone to the same school, and so for a demand to come through to sever all contact was seen to be unreasonable.<span id="more-731"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the demands of the letter were not finished, but became unfeasible. We were required to provide ‘confirmation by return’ that third party computer specialists hired by Latens/Pace would be allowed unfettered access to the premises and all equipment to forensically image the equipment and ‘assess any other use of such equipment in relation to the Confidential Information’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final demand was for us to undertake that, by 4pm the next day, any Confidential Information in our control would not be used or shared, but returned to Latens or destroyed at their option. We were happy to comply with this one, since we were safe in the knowledge that we didn’t have any of these supposed trade secrets.&nbsp;The letter then finished by informing the Directors of their possibly criminal liability in failing to return the stolen information and in handling stolen goods.. This was a difficulty, given that we had no stolen information to return. However, curiously for a supposed crime of this magnitude, Latens had elected not to involve the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our reply addressed all the points, but we paid particular attention to the third demand (forensically imaging all equipment), pointing out that, if we assisted Latens in imaging members’ personal laptops and other devices on the premises, we really would be handling stolen goods this time around, as well as committing several acts under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We were very firm in disagreeing with Latens/Pace on this point. We also elected to continue our usual contact with the member, given that we had seen no evidence so far of any theft of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the Directors had <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Eoghan-Murray-Latens-14.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters</a> delivered to their places of work reminding us of our ‘liability as an officer of the company for offences by the company under the Fraud Act 2006’ and to be ‘aware that there are sanctions in place under the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 with regard to the making of false statements with intent to deceive by company directors’.&nbsp;Not only is it, in our opinion, a defamation of character to be served by a legal aide in front of colleagues, we feel that this action was bordering on harassment and caused distress to us, given we were being threatened with the possibility of criminal prosecution in relation to an event that we had been first made aware of when a flurry of identical emails had landed in every inbox we had, whether or not the inbox was related to Farset Labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We felt we had no option but to seek legal advice and responded via our solicitors from this point onwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pinsent Masons then sent through a <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Farset_Labs_-undertakings_19_6_12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list of undertakings</a> required by them. All through this, immense pressure was put on the Directors to sign various documents within hours, with no real time to consult counsel or other authorities. We did not bow to these pressures, but it began to affect our running of Farset Labs and our everyday work and academic activities.&nbsp;Among these undertakings, key points included: provision of the network architecture within Farset and storage of electronic information; security arrangements within Farset Labs; and a provision of a log of the time, size and description of any electronic information flow from Latens to Farset.&nbsp;We then spent valuable time and effort trying to make Pinsent Masons understand that our front-end router does not log that information, so it was simply impossible for us to provide it, but the replies generally just quoted the same demands again and again.&nbsp;Several emails went back and forth, eating up time and money, before we finally got <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Revised-Undertakings-27.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of the undertakings</a> provided to us that would be possible for us to sign. We signed this and returned it, hoping that it would bring the situation to a conclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sadly, if anything, it got even more disjointed and difficult. Despite our repeated offers of a face-to-face meeting with Latens to help try and resolve the situation, the responses from Pinsent Masons ignored these, never mentioning them. The demands became more warped, sometimes making little sense. One of our personal favourites was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong><em>Answer 1.3(a) – Please confirm if the metal project boxes are lockable whilst also on&nbsp;the network when in the boxes.</em></strong></p>
<p>We assure you that this has <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Adam-Curry-Mills-Selig-enc-revised-undertakings-16.07.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not been taken out of context</a> in any way. None of the Directors of Farset nor our legal team could make sense of this and, at this stage, with the blessing of our solicitor, we informed Pinsent Masons that we would not be communicating further, as the requests had become repetitive, spurious and, we suspected, simply an attempt to harass us. We were also advised that, had Latens truly thought a breach had taken place, they would have collected evidence and brought all parties involved to court long before now or, at the very least, involved the PSNI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We then learned that the Latens personnel handling the Pinsent Masons team had gone on holiday towards the end of this, such was the severity, urgency and threat of this terrible crisis. This also explained why the technical acumen in the responses to our explanations was lacking. The net result of this experience was that we had lost time and sleep over a non-issue, mainly due to the extremely poor handling of the matter by Latens/Pace and their lawyers at Pinsent Masons. We have also been left with a gaping four-figure hole in our already-limited budget from legal expenses, which has threatened the very existence of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>After several months of silence from Pinsent Masons, we sent a letter via recorded delivery to the CEO of Pace detailing these events and the insanity of the entire episode, inviting comment and possibly aid, but have had no response, despite a follow-up phone call and ample time.<br />
In conclusion, the company and its Directors have been dragged through hell for no reason in a case that Latens/Pace now appear to have lost interest in, despite their initial misdirected fury. Farset Labs has been dealt a severe and nearly fatal financial blow, stunting its growth and preventing new equipment and services being offered to our members. In short, Latens/Pace have struck out needlessly at the voluntary technical community in Belfast and have sadly, though given the chance, made no effort to repair the consequences of, or even explain, their actions.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.34153042919933796"></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Anyone wishing to get further explanation of events, or to get in touch with the Directors of Farset Labs about this matter or otherwise should contact admin@farsetlabs.org.uk.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our members and followers, will be aware, Flacknite is our semi-regular monthly hackathon, spanning at least 24 hours, which is open to everyone. It provides a bed, a home and an excuse for projects that have been put back, and a lively environment for more time-sensitive ones. As always, they&#8217;re catered with food and drink, which this month was generously sponsored by <a title="Instil" href="http://instil.co/">Instil Software</a>.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s Flacknite ran on September 15th and 16th, and brought to life several different projects. Several internal software projects marched onwards towards completion, piecing together our in-house management system and building control network.</p>
<figure id="attachment_664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-664" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.131.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-664" title="2012-09-16 04.35.13" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.13-300x1791.jpg" alt="Culture Night Preparations" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-664" class="wp-caption-text">Electronics and LED-testing going on into the night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more exciting and eye-catching work took the form of some preparations for <a href="http://www.culturenightbelfast.com/">Culture Night</a>, which has been making news throughout Belfast and scheduled for tonight, Friday 21st September. Robin, an artist attending Culture Night, built and tested several high-power LED array bars, to be used in his project to under-illuminate a table. His work will be on show tonight near the Hayfield Market in Belfast City Centre.</p>
<p>A welcome break came in the form of <a href="http://operapizza.co.uk/">Opera Pizza</a>, which delivered a substantial order to our door for all to graze on. Beer and pizza flowed plentifully for several hours after the delivery.</p>
<figure id="attachment_666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-666" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.371.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-666 " title="2012-09-16 01.47.37" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.37-300x1791.jpg" alt="The BBC Micro lives!" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-666" class="wp-caption-text">The BBC Micro lives!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Work continued in other parts of the building, with Dan Reid and Tom Gilmour working with others to bring to life two BBC Micro computers, both of which had dead power supplies. They were successful and much of the remainder of the night was spent programming the Micros, and upgrading their RAM installations. Dan continued in the following days to install more RAM and software, and the two computers are approaching &#8220;perfect working order&#8221; condition.</p>
<p>Others worked on personal projects and private endeavours, and most stuck around until the daylight hours on Sunday. Numbers waned due to sleep, but recovered later on Sunday. Overall, numbers were good and the atmosphere was great. Our next Flacknite will be next month, on the 20th October, and will be publicised heavily to let everyone know.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.instil.co">Instil Software</a> for their generosity, and for everyone that came along to such a good night!</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flacknite was a great success, despite being stood up by Red Bull and some questionable sleeping patterns!</p>
<p>All in all, we got a lot done, and have learned a lot about how people work independently in these kind of events;</p>
<p>In terms of &#8216;stuff done&#8217;, probably the best show piece was <a title="Ryan Grieve" href="http://thegrieve.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Ryan Grieve</a>&#8216;s <a title="MicroID" href="http://ryangrieve.com/games/microid/" target="_blank">Microid game</a> that he wrote for  <strong><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild/" target="_blank">Mini LD</a></strong> games jam &#8211; 19th-20th May 2012, where he restricted himself to 64&#215;18 pixels, causing hours and hours of lost/distracted time for everyone else! Thanks Ryan!</p>
<p>Additionally, we got alot of work done in terms of our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-rfid-acc" target="_blank">RFID access system</a>, even though our planned external reader turned out to be a &#8216;useless&#8217; standard that no-one has&#8230; But our striker is working and we&#8217;re waiting on a new reader to open the space up to all. CCTV is up, but not ready yet, <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-cctv/activity" target="_blank">pending the arrival of our capture card</a>. Network is done to <a href="http://twitter.com/stealthii" target="_blank">Stealthii&#8217;s </a>satisfaction.</p>
<p>Andrew Luke got a lot of work done on his great <a title="Absence Comic" href="http://absencecomic.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for his comic about coping with Epilepsy, a project part funded by <a title="UnLtd" href="http://www.unltd.org.uk/" target="_blank">UnLtd</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/stevebiscuit" target="_blank">Steve Wilkin</a> got a <a href="http://sickbiscuit.com/blog/2012/05/20/an-ios-client-for-my-coffee-tracker-api/" target="_blank">iOS client for his CoffeeTracker</a> project built.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> and co were working on a Native iOS management app for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB </a>instances.</p>
<p>We all ate lots of <a title="Cupcakes" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N5S41ZnlKU/T7pveUCvZBI/AAAAAAAAA34/eDb6jMsu-QM/s912/IMG_20120519_134710.jpg" target="_blank">cupcakes</a>, and <a href="http://dominos.co.uk" target="_blank">Dominos</a> pizza, drank <a href="http://www.craftydevil.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crafty Devil</a> supplied Beer, and devoured <a href="http://planzai.com/" target="_blank">Planzai</a> supplied <a href="http://www.boojummex.com/" target="_blank">Boojum</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, Noah built <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203881118984978435/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>. Long may he build <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203893358639325184/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>! He&#8217;s inspired us to &#8216;acquiring&#8217; a box-o-lego&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for making it as awesome as it was. See you next time!</p>

<p>Farset Labs is planning on running an event to introduce any person of any age to embedded programming; spanning from building your own controller board that you can take home, right up to programming it with some basic functionality. But we want to get the community&#8217;s opinion before we set anything in stone.</p>
<p>Please, take a minute of your time to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ" target="_blank">this survey</a> so we can make the best event for you.<span id="more-325"></span></p>
<p>In other news,</p>
<ul>
<li>We broke through 100 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Likes last week, and no one noticed;</li>
<li><a href="http://springup.co" target="_blank">SpringUp</a> was a fantastic success, and we welcome the winning/runner-up teams, Al.rg and betExpertise to their free memberships;</li>
<li>Our open/closed status is now listed on the <a href="http://hackerspaces.me/wall" target="_blank">Global Hackerspace Wall</a> and our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Front Page</a> (which got a little redesign last week);</li>
<li>Our trip to the <a href="http://syncni.com/news/p.php?id=6182" target="_blank">ITE Titans</a> event at <a href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">The Titanic Belfast</a> was a very interesting evening for all involved;</li>
<li>Confirmed our Charitable Status (XT33366 if anyone cares) and we secured our Rates-exempt status (making the financial future a little less foggy);</li>
<li>Rolled out our temporary online membership / donation system (donation button is over that &gt; way &gt; *hint*);</li>
<li>Set up a <a title="Wiki" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Wiki</a> to manage the internals of the space (work very much in progress);</li>
<li>Set up a <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine</a> Project Management system (again, work in progress).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all in all, it&#8217;s starting to come together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-186" title="The Store" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-02-18.21.47-300x1791.jpg" alt="Equipment in the store" width="300" height="179" />Another day of frantic work and continuous driving has brought us much closer to our launch tomorrow. The plumbers have completely fitted the toilets to a great standard and the electricians are making sense of the circuits around the building; the puzzle pieces that were outside our control have pretty much fallen into place. After a long day driving to collect tables, hoovering endless dust and generally cleaning up, we&#8217;re about to pack up for the night, exhausted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve fitted out the reception area with a little more server equipment and a slightly fancier network configuration, and have the water supply turned on, making the space a lot more pleasant to be in. The contractors are finishing up and our outer window frames received a welcome coat of paint. Windows were scraped and the equipment store was further populated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, final preparations include the plumbers and electricians finishing up, the hopeful delivery of our electric cooker, preparations for the rooms and general last-minute cleaning.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see you all at our <a title="Launch Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191615090954138/">launch event</a> tomorrow at 3pm!</p>
