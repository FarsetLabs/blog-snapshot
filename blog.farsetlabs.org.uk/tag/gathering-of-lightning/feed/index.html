										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long hiatus, Farset Labs is back with a new take on our hugely successful  <a title="Gathering of Lightning – 28/08/2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightning-28082014/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> ad-hoc presentation series, once again thanks to support from <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">BCS-Belfast Chapter</a>, with a few changes based on our experiences of running GoL over the past <a title="Event Calendar" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/event-calendar/" target="_blank">4 years</a>.</p>
<p>While feedback from the events was unanimously positive, it was felt that GoL was drifting away from it’s original intent to share experience, to educate, and to excite people both in and around the Farset community, with more product and sales pitches percolating up to speak than real knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>In an effort to take things back to their bare bones, we’re stealing some nomenclature from “The Front Page of the Internet”, <a href="http://www.shellypalmer.com/2013/2013/05/explain-like-im-five" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a>.</p>
<p>“Explain Like I’m 5”, and it’s abbreviation, “ELi5”, is a slang term used on the Internet in response to an overly complicated answer to a question that requires significant in-advance experience before it can be understood.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2139 size-full" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fsl-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Albert-Einstein-If-you-cant-explain-it.png" alt="Albert Einstein - If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself." width="1000" height="512" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Albert-Einstein-If-you-cant-explain-it.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Albert-Einstein-If-you-cant-explain-it-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2139" class="wp-caption-text">Albert Einstein &#8211; If you can&#8217;t explain it to a six year old, you don&#8217;t understand it yourself.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>The target audience</strong> is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a <strong>beer</strong>, soft drink, <strong>pizza</strong> and fresh fruit intermission.</p>
<p><strong>The rules</strong> for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of<strong> 7 minutes</strong> to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li><strong>No Slides!</strong> The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic <strong>on the blackboard</strong> along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so<strong> be nice to him/her</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Punishment</strong> for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again! We&#8217;re happy to announce that the next instalment of our popular event series Gathering of Lightning will take place on Thursday 28th August at 6:30pm.</p>
<p>A series of speakers will have a maximum of 7 minutes to give an only-slightly-prepared speech/rant/eulogy on anything they feel strongly about. Audience participation is encouraged and speakers should be aware of foam-projectiles heading their way if they dare go over their time limit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8220589658_771ceeb8ed_c.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="219" />Past talks have ranged from wearable tech to beer to quantum mechanics to baking and we&#8217;re sure this lineup will be just as strange and wonderful. So far we&#8217;ve got our old regular, Daniel Porter ranting about something as yet undecided between the new Farset management system, and his Quake-net setup at this years QCon, Owen McEvoy talking about the launch of a brilliant Belfast based ethically sourced foods cooperative, and Sarah McBride from the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/culturetechfest/create-2014-a-creative-conference-made-by-young-pe">Create:2014</a> team talking about their kickstarter-funded conference. On the &#8216;maybe&#8217; list we have Jenni from <a href="http://www.tascomi.com/">Tascomi</a> ranting about parenting technically saavy children and Martin from <a href="http://www.gilchristandco.com/">Gilchrist&amp;Co</a> talking about his Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/662615347/accountsify-as-in-clarify-simplify-accountsify">Accountisfy</a>, along with the usual walk-in types we know and love!</p>
<p>Oh and if you&#8217;re not already convinced, we&#8217;ll be serving beer and pizza.</p>

<p>Gather one and all, for another round of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a> at Farset Labs!</p>
<p>As ever, we&#8217;re keen for people to raise their hands either as speakers or audience. If you&#8217;ve never been to one of our GoL nights before, it&#8217;s an easy intro to the community. Past talks have ranged from Quantum Physics to baking, and from wearable tech to beer. And if you have something you can condense into seven minutes that might prick the interest of a geeky, creative group – let us know.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gathering-of-lightning-tickets-11832099127">register here</a> so we know how much beer and pizza to get.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be beer and pizza&#8230;</p>
<p>Details: Thurs 5 June, from 18:00</p>

Normal rules apply; Speakers have 7 minutes to talk about something they&#8217;re passionate about, with audience heckling encouraged, and the opportunity for a few more minutes of Q&amp;A after at the compères discretion. This time around, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/clairedotw">Claire Wilgar </a>will be compère-ing (we expect Christmas Hats!) and for a change we have a rough idea of whose talking!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jiannhughes.com/" target="_blank">Jiann Hughes</a> will be talking about her work in the intersection between Art, Culture, and Technology</li>
<li>Colin Kelsey/Matt Hazely will be explaining some of the beer brewing techniques they are experimenting with in the labs</li>
<li>Will Burr from Billy Goat Entertainment will be demoing some of his currently-<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1236117571/her-majestys-spiffing" target="_blank">Kickstarting</a> game, Her Majesty&#8217;s Spiffing</li>
<li>Dr David Laverty, for Queen&#8217;s University Belfast&#8217;s Energy, Power and Intelligent Systems (EPIC) group, who are working on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/QUBEV" target="_blank"> converting a classic DeLorean to an Electric drive train</a></li>
<li>Sebastian Heinz from SARC will <strong>hopefully</strong> be demoing his wildly successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2012099678/patchblocks-programmable-mini-synth-modules" target="_blank">Patchblocks</a> project that has already obliterated its £10k funding goal</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll also <strong>hopefully</strong> have a visit from some developers from <a href="http://www.aepona.com" target="_blank">Aepona</a>, a locally based API-as-a-service company recently acquired by <a href="http://www.aepona.com/intel-and-aepona/" target="_blank">Intel</a></li>
<li>Finally, we&#8217;re <strong>hoping</strong> to get a short talk on some of the work done by PWC&#8217;s Belfast Based Digital Forensic Team</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we try to keep a few slots open for walk ins, so if you feel inspired to talk about something, let us know! Drinks and munchies are provided by the brilliant folks at the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">British Computing Society</a>, who have supported us throughout our <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightening/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> programme for the past year and a half.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>And to kick things off, an apology; our provisionally scheduled Raspberry Jam on the 12th has been postponed until after the exam season as it&#8217;s been difficult to get people able to help out at the event. Raspberry Jam will return February</p>

<p>Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Update] Brendan Drain from Brain and Nerd, who had recent success with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nyphur/predestination-a-turn-based-space-4x-strategy-game">Predestination</a>, will be talking about how he got started in Games Development (and what to avoid!)</li>
<li>[Update] Niall Bole, Engineer, Gamer, Organiser, and Placement student at NACCO will be talking about &#8216;Using <a href="http://www.ashtoncentre.com/fablab">Fablabs</a> for Fun and Profit&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMathematicsandPhysics/Research/ResearchStudents/StudentInfo/?id=540">Colin Kelsey</a>, from QUB&#8217;s Centre for Plasma Physics, with what he describes as &#8220;either functional plasma physics or a big surprise&#8221;</li>
<li>Rebecca Lutton, a mechanical engineer of <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Bright-Club-Belfast-Bright-Club-Belfast-9-Women-on-Top">Bright Club </a>fame with &#8216;Observational Humerology &#8211; The curse of innuendo&#8217;</li>
<li>Andrew Bolster on getting your Raspberry Pi to talk to the real world using the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a></li>
<li>Dylan Wylie, another Physicist, who is ambiguously talking about &#8216;<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3shy07.jpg">Quantum Theory, Maybe</a>&#8216;</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all our lighting events, this is an open call, so even if you just want to say something on the night, we&#8217;ll have the blackboard grid up so can literally sign up to talk during the other talks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also hopefully be live streaming this one&#8230; maybe&#8230;<br />

<h1>Global Game Jam Flacknite: Fri 25th<a href="http://flacknite-ggj13.eventbrite.com/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-959" alt="ggjlogo1dates" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ggjlogo1dates-300x521.png" width="300" height="52" /></a></h1>
<p>This time around we&#8217;re collaborating with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster&#8217;s Office of Innovation</a> to run the 2013 Northern Ireland <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">Global Game Jam</a></p>
<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world&#8217;s largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games… while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don’t code can contribute to a game.</p>
<p>This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Donations are not required for this event</strong> as refreshment costs are covered by <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">UUOI</a>, but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!<br />

<h1>Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com" rel="attachment wp-att-960"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960" alt="logo" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo-150x1501.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></h1>
<p>After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi (including the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>)</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, <strong>but please try and BYO monitor.</strong> We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, if anyone would like to present any projects or just help out with the organisation of this event (or give feedback based on the last events) get in touch with us via events@farsetlabs.org.uk (or any of the dozen or so other ways you&#8217;ll be able to get us on!)</div>
</div>
