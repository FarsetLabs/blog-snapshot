<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h1>



<ul><li>In light of current HMG and NI Executive Guidance, and in accordance to our communicated <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/coronavirus">staging plans</a>, we’ve decided to begin a phased return to Unit 1, starting <strong>Wednesday the 24nd of June at 10am</strong>,&nbsp;</li><li>There will be new extraordinary guidelines in place regarding conduct within the space, enforcing social distancing, and relevant PPE and hygiene recommendations.</li><li><strong>Access will be ‘opt-in’</strong> so if you wish to return to the space, email <a href="mailto:art@farsetlabs.org.uk" data-type="mailto" data-id="mailto:art@farsetlabs.org.uk">art@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> and we’ll arrange for you to digitally sign the pre-return disclaimer and issue you with new access control codes.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other News While We’ve Been in Lockdown</h2>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Guidelines</h1>



<p><em>Published both here and at </em><a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy"><em>https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/coronavirus_return_policy</em></a><em> for completeness</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purpose</h2>



<p>The purpose of these guidelines is to set out the procedures and restrictions that are put in place to allow Farset Labs to open in a safe manner during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</p>



<p>These temporary guidelines will remain under constant review, with particular respect to any changes in government guidelines or restrictions. Should any subsequent government policy contradict any aspect of these guidelines it will be expected that Farset Labs and it’s members will immediately comply with government policy.</p>



<p>In issuing these guidelines the Labs trustees acknowledge that it may be necessary to close the building again at short notice in response to future government directives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organisational Named Person For COVID-19 Response</h2>



<p>Best practices dictate that organisations should have a named person responsible for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>As such, Art Knipe will be responsible for these guidelines, will be the contact person for questions regarding our response to COVID-19 and will be responsible for organisational contact tracing in the event of a member reporting an infection. (art@farsetlabs.org.uk).</p>



<p>Should Art be unable to fulfil this role for any reason Colin Mitchell will deputise (colin.mitchell@farsetlabs.org.uk)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Guidelines for Reopening of Farset Labs</h2>



<p>Farset Labs will begin a phased reopening on 24/06/20 at 10am. The reopening will proceed based on the following guidance:</p>



<ul><li>Upon reopening we will request that our members continue to work from home if they can, in line with the<a href="https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf"> guidance from the NI Executive</a>.</li><li>Access to the building will be subject to these new guidelines.</li><li>It will be left to the discretion and good sense of individual members to decide whether they can continue to work from home or need to use the space.</li><li>All members will be required to complete and sign an online Pre-Return form which indicates their agreement with these guidelines. This must be done before they can return to the space.</li></ul>



<p>If you wish to return to the space at this time, you must contact Art Knipe by email (art@farsetlabs.org.uk) to notify him of your intention to return. You will then be asked to fill in a Pre-Return Disclaimer, after which you will be given new access control codes.</p>



<p><strong>Do not return to the space if you have not already digitally signed the pre-return disclaimer as you will not be permitted in the building</strong></p>
