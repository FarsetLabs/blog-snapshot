										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>This is going to sound old hat, but here at Farset, we&#8217;re all about cultivating an environment where the next generation of technologists can come into their own, but as the old saying goes, to teach is to learn twice.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we are always encouraging not only peer-teaching within the space and at Farset events, but also try and encourage our members to take part in STEM outreach to local schools.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;ve been internally working on a <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">semi-regularly-updated wiki of the STEM events that need help in Northern Ireland</a>, and hopefully, people will step up to the plate and give their time and energy to the next generation of technologists.</p>
<p>And before you say &#8220;That&#8217;s the teachers job&#8221;, just think back to your own teachers. Did they really know about the latest and greatest technologies going on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your IT teacher show you how to deploy RoR services on <a href="http://www.golygon.com/2010/11/tutorial-ruby-on-rails-hosted-on-amazon-cloud/" target="_blank">cloud based LAMP stacks</a>?</li>
<li>Did your technology teacher show you how to put an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Preliminary-SPI-on-the-Pi-Communicating-with-a-/" target="_blank">accelerometer and GPS on a Raspberry Pi </a>to act as a vehicle data logger?</li>
<li>Did your Geography teacher show you have to use GOV.UK open data resources to <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/buses/realtime.htm" target="_blank">map GIS data in real-time</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet they didn&#8217;t (obviously replace those with temporally relevant technologies&#8230;).</p>
<p>As an aside, we&#8217;re trying to find someone to fund travel expenses for such outreach, because we definitely can&#8217;t! But if you&#8217;re free at any of the listed times, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us or the listed contact points on the wiki and give back to the education system.</p>
<h1><a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">GO HERE AND PLEASE GIVE YOUR TIME</a></h1>
