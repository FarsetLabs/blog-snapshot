										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Interested in getting hands experiences on with the BBC micro:bit, due to land in the hands of every Year 8 student in the summer term? Now’s your chance!</strong></p>
<p>Farset Labs will be running a free, hands on &#8220;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-bbc-microbit-tickets-22031409539" target="_blank">Getting started with the BBC micro:bit</a>&#8221; Computing at Schools Northern Ireland Hub workshop on the 10th March 2016 from 6:30pm-9:00pm at Farset Labs.<br />
<strong>We will hope to cover</strong><br />
&#8211; What is the micro:bit?<br />
&#8211; Getting started and making your first programs<br />
&#8211; Brief overview of the different programming environments available<br />
&#8211; More in depth look at Python on the micro:bit<br />
&#8211; Ideas for use in the classroom</p>
<p>We will have a few computers available at Farset, but if possible, please bring your own laptop.</p>
<p>If you have any queries or questions, feel free to drop myself (Andrew Mulholland, Outreach Manager @ Farset Labs) an email at andrew.mulholland@farsetlabs.org.uk</p>
<p>This event is supported by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">Farset Labs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cas_ni" target="_blank">Computing at Schools NI</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Do I need to have any previous programming experience?</strong><br />
Nope! We are targeting the workshop at those will little or no programming experience.</p>
<p><strong>I am not a secondary school level teacher (am a primary school teacher, higher education academic or from industry), can I come down and take part?</strong><br />
Unfortunately we expect high demand for this workshop so have to prioritise secondary teachers for now. If we still have space closer to the workshop, we would still love to see you there though. Put your name down for the waiting list for the &#8220;Other&#8221; ticket type and we will be in contact closer to the date.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demand, we well look into launching follow-on events for a wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to provide my own BBC micro:bit?</strong><br />
Nope! We have been kindly been provided a set by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything then I need to bring?</strong><br />
If you have a laptop running Windows, Mac OS or Linux, then it would be great if you could bring it. Although we have some computers available, it is better to learn and practice on familiar equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there free parking available nearby?</strong><br />
Yip! Weavers Court Business estate (which Farset Labs is located within) has ample onsite free parking.</p>
