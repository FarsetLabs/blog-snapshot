										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p><a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/?p=558" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> has been an active member of the Farset community since he was dragged down from native Coleraine to attend the <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/raspberry-jam-so-good-were-going-to-preserve-it-in-our-calendar/" target="_blank">first</a> Raspberry Jam in Northern Ireland, hosted by Farset Labs in the Event space in November 2012.</p>
<p>Since then he&#8217;s gone from strength to strength and has since taken over the running of the Jam&#8217;s,and is on the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/meet-the-creative-technologists/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Creative Technologist programme</a> with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.. Andrew is also the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/index.html" target="_blank">Non Executive Manager</a> for Outreach and lead on our <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-outreach-201516-call-for-mentors/" target="_blank">Outreach project</a> with support from <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/" target="_blank">DCAL</a>, CultureTech and the Pi Foundation, introducing young people to technology in the most fun ways possible.</p>
<p>As part of his responsibilities as a Creative Technologist, Farset Labs supported Andrew taking the Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/dots/" target="_blank">Dots Boards</a> activity to the BBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/367rNH85VbpVWytkT61fv9D/make-it-digital-at-culturetech-2015" target="_blank">MakeItDigital</a> tent at the <a href="http://culturetech.co/project/maker-city/" target="_blank">CultureTech</a> festival in Derry, where it also joined Dr Robin Price&#8217;s <a href="http://robinprice.net/2015/03/this-is-not-a-table/" target="_blank">&#8220;This Is Not A Table&#8221;</a> that was constructed (and usually lives in) in the Farset Labs workshop. I managed to stick around and help for a bit but it was clear I wasn&#8217;t needed, and the event ran very smoothly (if messily), all in all engaging with over 2000 children and young people.</p>
<p>The below is a guest blog, <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/?p=558" target="_blank">originally published</a> by Andrew Mulholland, reproduced with permission.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #999999;">Foreword by: Andrew Bolster</span></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>After the major success of the Raspberry Pi Foundation Dots board activity with Minecraft Pi at Liverpool Makefest and Dublin Maker, there was one final event left that I was down to help out at before the start of the new university term, the BBC Make It Digital event at Culturetech!</p>
<p>So on Friday 18th September, me and a set of volunteers from <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Labs</a> and the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html">Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam</a> made our way to outside the Guildhall in Londonderry to the massive Make It Digital tent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_559" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-559" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4398.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-559" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4398-1024x768.jpg" alt="It was a very big tent!" width="474" height="356" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-559" class="wp-caption-text">It was a very big tent!</figcaption></figure>
<p>With us, we had a set of 8 Raspberry Pis (with monitors and all the cables required for them) and a box of 100 Raspberry Pi Foundation Dots boards ready to be filled in with <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-50ml/">Bare Conductive Electric paint</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-560" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4334.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-560" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4334-1024x768.jpg" alt="100 Dots boards, ready to be filled in." width="474" height="356" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-560" class="wp-caption-text">100 Dots boards, ready to be filled in.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The activity</h2>
<p>The activity we were running involved kids filling in one of the Dots boards with electric paint, then attaching these to a Raspberry Pi and seeing whatever they had drawn appear in 3d in Minecraft.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/dots/">Dots boards</a> were developed by Rachel Rayns from the Raspberry Pi Foundation as an activity to engage people of all ages (especially younger children) in technology.</p>
<p>They are an extremely simple circuit board featuring a 40 pin Raspberry Pi header, a single resistor and a series of pads on the front.<br />
These pads are the key to it all, they feature an inner circular pad and an outer ring. Between the 2 pads is a gap which can be bridged by electric paint.<br />
Bridging the pads allows the Raspberry Pi to read it like any input, for example a button. There is 22 dot-to-dot pads, 4 colour selection pads, a pad on a cloud and finally a pad on a parachuting bear.</p>
<p>Although we tell the kids to do the dot-to-dot, in fact all that is actually required is a dot on each pad you want to select.</p>
<h3>The software</h3>
<p>For the activity, there is 2 options for the software on the Raspberry Pi side.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-rpi-dots">original rpi_dots python program</a> written by <a href="https://twitter.com/EbenUpton">Eben Upton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall">Ben Nuttall</a> that simply if you have enough pins covered, an airplane (in your selected colour) will appear on screen.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/gbaman/dots-minecraft">Minecraft Pi program</a> written by myself while on my internship with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It splits the plane up into 10 sections, each of which is added to a 3d version of the plane inside Minecraft if it is dotted. Once the user is happy with their plane, they can attempt to see if the plane will fly. If they have enough dots dotted, the plane will fly across the sky, if not it will plummet to the ground and crash.<br />
If the user selects the bear, a parachuting bear will come down from the clouds and if they select the cloud, grey clouds will be added to the scene and lightning will strike down.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Liverpool Makefest, Dublin Maker and the BBC Make It Digital event, we used the 2nd option, the Minecraft Pi program.</p>
<h2>Friday evening</h2>
<p>The event ran from 6pm-10pm on the Friday evening to coincide with Londonderry Culturenight and the many other family friendly events going on in Londonderry that evening.</p>
<p>Within minutes of the doors being opened, we were swamped by people wanting to have a go with our activity, so much so we immediately discovered we had underestimated the number of volunteers we would need to run the activity!<br />
Thankfully, the BBC stepped in and we able to provide 2 awesome guys from their team to help out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-564" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_8755.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-564" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_8755-1024x683.jpg" alt="We tired Mark out so much, he was half asleep at this point..." width="474" height="316" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-564" class="wp-caption-text">We tired Mark out so much, he was half asleep at this point with black hands from cleaning so many boards!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the 4 hours that evening, we had roughly 800 Dots Boards filled in (and then cleaned)!<br />
Because we weren&#8217;t able to keep up with the demand, a hefty chunk of those 800 boards were filled in in pairs or families so the number of people taking part in the activity that evening was 1000+.</p>
<p>We also were visited by some pretty awesome Minecraft in education people who came by to try out the activity including COO of Mojang, <a href="https://twitter.com/vubui">Vu Bue</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Deirdre206">Deirdre Quarnstrom</a> (Director of Minecraft Education from Microsoft) and <a href="https://twitter.com/Aalvisto">Santeri Koivisto</a> (CEO of Teachergaming).</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>The event ran from 10am-6pm on the Saturday. It coincided with the Londonderry Maker City event that was happening in next door in the Guildhall.</p>
<p>By the Saturday morning, I had been able to get some additional volunteers over to help out, although even with a team of 9 people (plus Matt from the BBC), we were still overwhelmed later in the day.</p>
<p>Although the event started at 10am, it didn&#8217;t get busy till after midday which allowed us to do some much needed Dots board cleaning catch up, table cleaning and GPIO pin fixing.</p>
<p>After midday though, we were basically constantly assisting people with the activity. This continued till around 5:30pm when it started to quiet down again.</p>
<p>On the Saturday we also set up a Raspberry Pi Camera module to do a timelapse of the event. Below is roughly 2 hours of the event in 55 seconds. As can be seen, it was incredibly busy!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From feedback from parents, kids and the BBC, we can say that the activity was a complete success. With over 2000 people of all ages taking part from kids as young as 4, right up to senior citizens of 80+ years.</p>
<p>This is what makes the Dots Board activity so awesome, it really is suitable for people of all ages, thanks to its simplicity.</p>
<p>Big thanks to the BBC Make It Digital team for inviting us along and looking after us while in Londonderry, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> for the Dots boards, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Farset Labs</a> for use of their equipment and to my volunteers, couldn&#8217;t ask for a better team over the 2 days.</p>

After a long summer hiatus, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> is relaunching at Farset Labs, under old management on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214" target="_blank">Friday the 2nd of October from 17:30 to 19:30</a>. We&#8217;re also unveiling separate FarsetDojo <a href="http://twitter.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/farsetdojo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> pages where we&#8217;ll be sharing what goes on, so give them a Follow and a Like to keep up to date with the latest Dojo happenings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farset-labs-coderdojo-tickets-18085833214?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=18085833214" alt="Eventbrite - Farset Labs CoderDojo" /></a></p>
<p>But this post isn&#8217;t (just) about that. Farset Labs was built around the idea of exploration and giving back to the wider community, presenting opportunities that people wouldn&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to.</p>
<p>Over the past three and a half years, we&#8217;ve helped so many people, young and not so young, engage with technology in a much more human way, and we do that on the strength of our mentors.</p>
<p>And basically, <strong>we need you</strong>!</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in helping out with <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/coderdojo.html" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>, <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>, or just want to put your name down on the &#8220;call out&#8221; list for our outreach events, please take two minutes and fill in the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/AiTPyxICVB" target="_blank">form</a> below. Your contact information will be private and you will only be contacted for relevant outreach activities.</p>
<p>Also you don&#8217;t have to be a Farset Labs <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/index.html" target="_blank">Member</a> to be a Mentor (but it always helps!), and if you&#8217;ve got any questions about Farset&#8217;s outreach programmes, give us a shout on <a href="mailto:outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Farset Labs &amp; <a href="http://culturetech.co" target="_blank">CultureTECH</a> are hosting a <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/raspberry_jam.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> at the Nerve Centre, Derry-Londonderry on Saturday, March 28th, 1pm-5pm as part of <a href="http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/festival/creativity-month" target="_blank">Creativity Month</a>!</strong></p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use.</p>
<p>While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fsl-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800.jpg" alt="raspberryjam_800" width="800" height="533" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/raspberryjam_800-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />This session is suitable for kids of all ages, and no previous knowledge is required. You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along.</p>
<p><em>The event is FREE to attend but spaces are very limited so please only book if you can attend and no more than 2 spaces per booking. Thanks!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a combined position paper and call-to-action for a project that many of us have been working on behind the scenes for a long time now, especially <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">Andrew Mulholland</a> who&#8217;s taken over the operation of the <a title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam 5 (EU Code week)" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/northern-ireland-raspberry-jam-5-eu-code-week/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a> programme.</p>
<p><iframe title="Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam December" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTQdCBeCHTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Andrew and I collaborated on this document to put forward our plans for a school outreach programme built on the experience we&#8217;ve gained from running the Jam programme in Belfast for the past two years, including a collaboration between Farset Labs, Digital Circle and W5 that brought teachers together from across the province to share best practice for ICT education, as well as receiving our &#8216;wisdom&#8217; from running <a title="Get Kids Coding, Designing and Building This Summer with Our Special Four-Week CoderDojo Course" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/get-kids-coding-designing-and-building-this-summer-with-our-special-four-week-coderdojo-course/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> and Jam-like programmes. This programme was assessed DCAL and was<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/250367086/DCAL-Evaluation-Report-Raspberry-Pi-Project" target="_blank"> very well received</a> but due to personnel changes in some relevant organisations, has not been directly carried on as a full pilot programme.</p>
<p>We hope to change that, and thanks in part to Andrew&#8217;s recent successes at the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">TalkTalk Digital Hero</a> awards, as well as working over the summer with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we&#8217;ve secured match funding up to £4,000 to support the proposed programme.</p>
<p>But we need your help to drum up the rest of our estimated £8,000 programme costs, and hopefully this document will help. Have a read at our thoughts, and Andrew and I are more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or ideas about the proposed programme.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that <a href="culturetech.co" target="_blank">The CultureTech Festival</a> have pledged £1,000 towards this programme, as well as inviting us to participate in three events in the North West.</p>

<p>The kids worked through a number of challenges, the main being building their own reaction timer game using <a href="http://simplesi.net/scratchgpio/" target="_blank">ScratchGPIO</a>, a breadboard and a number of components.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1957" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2-534x10241.jpg" alt="2" width="534" height="1024" /></p>

<p>We also had a film crew in filming the Raspberry Jam from Fuzzy Duck (filming for TalkTalk) after Andrew won the <a href="http://digitalheroes.talktalk.co.uk/2014-winners/" target="_blank">Next Generation Digital Hero</a> award. They were making a film of what he does which included the Raspberry Jam. The short film should be out in a few weeks.</p>

<p>In between creating awesome reaction timer games, playing with RGB LEDs and hacking <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, the kids also found time to make use of the event space blackboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1961" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6-1024x6851.jpg" alt="6" width="670" height="448" /></p>

<p>We have some great news on the Raspberry Jam front in Northern Ireland! We&#8217;re planning to make our <a title="Return of Raspberry Jam" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/return-of-raspberry-jam/">Raspberry Jams</a> at Farset Labs a lot more frequent (instead of the current roughly every 6 months). We are looking into once a month or bimonthly.</p>
<p>Before we start though doing more frequent Raspberry Jams we want to grab some feedback from you, even if you have never attended a Raspberry Jam before.</p>
<p>Previous events have covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting Started with your Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Hardware interfacing for Scratch using <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>, <a href="http://cymplecy.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/scratch-gpio-version-2-introduction-for-beginners/">Scratch GPIO</a> and <a href="http://piborg.org/ledborg">LEDBorgs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> on your Pi</li>
<li>Building complex animations with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></li>
<li>And lots of sharing of individual projects like Bangor Academy&#8217;s <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/2013/01/25/pi-cade-project-team-at-bangor-academy/">PiCade</a>, a <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/?p=97">Lego PiBot</a>, some great Scratch games, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to figure out what you want to learn, what type of things you would like to see at a Raspberry Jam (Talks, Q&amp;As, hands on workshops etc).</p>
<p>So please take a few minutes to go through our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cr3AptTeKW7jGHnNc_yOdNTMiLkglObZunwhIzrCf0A/viewform" target="_blank">really quick anonymous survey</a>, you have the chance to give your opinion on what we do at the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams for the next few months!</p>
<p>We hope to announce the date of the first in the new series of Raspberry Jams within the next few days so keep an eye on the Farset labs blog and social media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest project  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>

<p><strong>Date &#8211; 16th November</strong><br />
<strong>Time &#8211; 1pm to 5pm</strong><br />
<strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet regularly to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one. We may even have a few spare you can use on the day.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi with flashy lights and ScratchGPIO</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are very welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have an awesome pi project you have been working on, we would love you to bring it along and show it off in the show and tell.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>THIS EVENT IS IN HIGH DEMAND SO PLEASE BOOK AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT</strong></div>
</div>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>And to kick things off, an apology; our provisionally scheduled Raspberry Jam on the 12th has been postponed until after the exam season as it&#8217;s been difficult to get people able to help out at the event. Raspberry Jam will return February</p>
<h1>GoL: Thur 17th Jan<a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189138854?ref=ebtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189138854&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - Gathering of Lightning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-958" alt="light-wide" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/light-wide-300x1511.jpg" width="300" height="151" /></a></h1>
<p>Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Update] Brendan Drain from Brain and Nerd, who had recent success with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nyphur/predestination-a-turn-based-space-4x-strategy-game">Predestination</a>, will be talking about how he got started in Games Development (and what to avoid!)</li>
<li>[Update] Niall Bole, Engineer, Gamer, Organiser, and Placement student at NACCO will be talking about &#8216;Using <a href="http://www.ashtoncentre.com/fablab">Fablabs</a> for Fun and Profit&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMathematicsandPhysics/Research/ResearchStudents/StudentInfo/?id=540">Colin Kelsey</a>, from QUB&#8217;s Centre for Plasma Physics, with what he describes as &#8220;either functional plasma physics or a big surprise&#8221;</li>
<li>Rebecca Lutton, a mechanical engineer of <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Bright-Club-Belfast-Bright-Club-Belfast-9-Women-on-Top">Bright Club </a>fame with &#8216;Observational Humerology &#8211; The curse of innuendo&#8217;</li>
<li>Andrew Bolster on getting your Raspberry Pi to talk to the real world using the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a></li>
<li>Dylan Wylie, another Physicist, who is ambiguously talking about &#8216;<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3shy07.jpg">Quantum Theory, Maybe</a>&#8216;</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all our lighting events, this is an open call, so even if you just want to say something on the night, we&#8217;ll have the blackboard grid up so can literally sign up to talk during the other talks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also hopefully be live streaming this one&#8230; maybe&#8230;<br />

<h1>Global Game Jam Flacknite: Fri 25th<a href="http://flacknite-ggj13.eventbrite.com/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-959" alt="ggjlogo1dates" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ggjlogo1dates-300x521.png" width="300" height="52" /></a></h1>
<p>This time around we&#8217;re collaborating with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster&#8217;s Office of Innovation</a> to run the 2013 Northern Ireland <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">Global Game Jam</a></p>
<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world&#8217;s largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games… while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don’t code can contribute to a game.</p>
<p>This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Donations are not required for this event</strong> as refreshment costs are covered by <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">UUOI</a>, but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!<br />

<h1>Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com" rel="attachment wp-att-960"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960" alt="logo" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo-150x1501.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></h1>
<p>After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Also, if anyone would like to present any projects or just help out with the organisation of this event (or give feedback based on the last events) get in touch with us via events@farsetlabs.org.uk (or any of the dozen or so other ways you&#8217;ll be able to get us on!)</div>
