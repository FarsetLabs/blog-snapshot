										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Conor Robinson for Space-Stuff (<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs/posts/1145573468796794">quite literally</a>) and Pip Shea to her great adventures down under, it&#8217;s time to launch our 2016 Director Elections. Nominations for the two soon-to-be-vacant Directors chairs will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday 2nd September</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nominate themselves.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their name.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Monday 5th September</strong> (Conveniently coinciding with the next Town Hall) and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 30th September</strong>.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> In the event that there are less than 4 nominees, only one Director seat will be voted on and nominations will be reopened later this year.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/director-elections/" target="_blank">elections</a>, available on this blog.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Good luck!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help us understand the needs of our member base, and to point us toward the areas we need to improve upon, we&#8217;ve come up with a short member survey for the New Year. This contains questions regarding each of our management areas, and should help us to improve Farset Labs to better serve you.</p>
<p>The survey is open to all members, regardless of membership duration or level. (Management included!)</p>
<p>All active members have been emailed with this survey, and so far roughly 50% have responded. It&#8217;s quite possible that some of the email addresses we&#8217;ve used are old and inactive, however. <strong>If you&#8217;re a current member and haven&#8217;t already received a link to our survey, please email us (admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) and let us know!</strong></p>
<p>The survey will close at <strong>Midnight on Tuesday 19th January</strong>. Once the survey closes, the results will be published, along with our plans!</p>

<p>In conjunction with Evorack&#8217;s infrastructure and experience, Farset Labs hopes to roll-out server hosting tools to our members, enabling them to develop, test, build (and break) cool cloud apps and services.</p>
<p>With the number of new innovations in web-based apps and services having some sort of cloud back-end, it is only natural that Farset provides these resources to our members.</p>
<p>Over the next days we&#8217;ll be transferring much of our web infrastructure to Evorack, and implementing member level, private web storage, VPN, and community application servers. As with most things there may be a few hiccups&#8230; But we&#8217;ll make it through.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome on board guys!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">UPDATED</span>:&nbsp;</strong></em><em>The original letters sent to Farset Labs have been linked to throughout the article for context and transparency. Further questions will be answered via email at admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs has gone from strength to strength since opening its doors in April of this year, and the community has grown and matured quickly, but our summer progress was slower than was hoped for. Our entire model and ethos is built on transparency and democracy, so we publish this document to explain to our membership and supporters the difficulties placed in our path due to litigation launched by Latens/Pace plc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of the blue, on the 14th June, multiple copies of <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Letter-to-Farset-Labs-14th-June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> were hand delivered to Farset Labs by Pinsent Masons, legal representatives of Latens/Pace, as well as emailed to several different accounts of the Directors whether they were Farset Labs related or personal, work and university inboxes. One of our members had been accused on their last day of work of stealing sensitive Confidential Information from their employer and transmitting it to Farset Labs. The letter explained that we had possession of their property, and that it it was on our equipment. It demanded that we exclude an allegedly-involved member from the premises and cut all communication with him pending completion of their investigations. Two of the Directors have known the member for almost a decade, having gone to the same school, and so for a demand to come through to sever all contact was seen to be unreasonable.<span id="more-731"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the demands of the letter were not finished, but became unfeasible. We were required to provide ‘confirmation by return’ that third party computer specialists hired by Latens/Pace would be allowed unfettered access to the premises and all equipment to forensically image the equipment and ‘assess any other use of such equipment in relation to the Confidential Information’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final demand was for us to undertake that, by 4pm the next day, any Confidential Information in our control would not be used or shared, but returned to Latens or destroyed at their option. We were happy to comply with this one, since we were safe in the knowledge that we didn’t have any of these supposed trade secrets.&nbsp;The letter then finished by informing the Directors of their possibly criminal liability in failing to return the stolen information and in handling stolen goods.. This was a difficulty, given that we had no stolen information to return. However, curiously for a supposed crime of this magnitude, Latens had elected not to involve the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our reply addressed all the points, but we paid particular attention to the third demand (forensically imaging all equipment), pointing out that, if we assisted Latens in imaging members’ personal laptops and other devices on the premises, we really would be handling stolen goods this time around, as well as committing several acts under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We were very firm in disagreeing with Latens/Pace on this point. We also elected to continue our usual contact with the member, given that we had seen no evidence so far of any theft of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the Directors had <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Eoghan-Murray-Latens-14.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters</a> delivered to their places of work reminding us of our ‘liability as an officer of the company for offences by the company under the Fraud Act 2006’ and to be ‘aware that there are sanctions in place under the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 with regard to the making of false statements with intent to deceive by company directors’.&nbsp;Not only is it, in our opinion, a defamation of character to be served by a legal aide in front of colleagues, we feel that this action was bordering on harassment and caused distress to us, given we were being threatened with the possibility of criminal prosecution in relation to an event that we had been first made aware of when a flurry of identical emails had landed in every inbox we had, whether or not the inbox was related to Farset Labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We felt we had no option but to seek legal advice and responded via our solicitors from this point onwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pinsent Masons then sent through a <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Farset_Labs_-undertakings_19_6_12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list of undertakings</a> required by them. All through this, immense pressure was put on the Directors to sign various documents within hours, with no real time to consult counsel or other authorities. We did not bow to these pressures, but it began to affect our running of Farset Labs and our everyday work and academic activities.&nbsp;Among these undertakings, key points included: provision of the network architecture within Farset and storage of electronic information; security arrangements within Farset Labs; and a provision of a log of the time, size and description of any electronic information flow from Latens to Farset.&nbsp;We then spent valuable time and effort trying to make Pinsent Masons understand that our front-end router does not log that information, so it was simply impossible for us to provide it, but the replies generally just quoted the same demands again and again.&nbsp;Several emails went back and forth, eating up time and money, before we finally got <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Revised-Undertakings-27.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of the undertakings</a> provided to us that would be possible for us to sign. We signed this and returned it, hoping that it would bring the situation to a conclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sadly, if anything, it got even more disjointed and difficult. Despite our repeated offers of a face-to-face meeting with Latens to help try and resolve the situation, the responses from Pinsent Masons ignored these, never mentioning them. The demands became more warped, sometimes making little sense. One of our personal favourites was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong><em>Answer 1.3(a) – Please confirm if the metal project boxes are lockable whilst also on&nbsp;the network when in the boxes.</em></strong></p>
<p>We assure you that this has <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Adam-Curry-Mills-Selig-enc-revised-undertakings-16.07.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not been taken out of context</a> in any way. None of the Directors of Farset nor our legal team could make sense of this and, at this stage, with the blessing of our solicitor, we informed Pinsent Masons that we would not be communicating further, as the requests had become repetitive, spurious and, we suspected, simply an attempt to harass us. We were also advised that, had Latens truly thought a breach had taken place, they would have collected evidence and brought all parties involved to court long before now or, at the very least, involved the PSNI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We then learned that the Latens personnel handling the Pinsent Masons team had gone on holiday towards the end of this, such was the severity, urgency and threat of this terrible crisis. This also explained why the technical acumen in the responses to our explanations was lacking. The net result of this experience was that we had lost time and sleep over a non-issue, mainly due to the extremely poor handling of the matter by Latens/Pace and their lawyers at Pinsent Masons. We have also been left with a gaping four-figure hole in our already-limited budget from legal expenses, which has threatened the very existence of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>After several months of silence from Pinsent Masons, we sent a letter via recorded delivery to the CEO of Pace detailing these events and the insanity of the entire episode, inviting comment and possibly aid, but have had no response, despite a follow-up phone call and ample time.<br />
In conclusion, the company and its Directors have been dragged through hell for no reason in a case that Latens/Pace now appear to have lost interest in, despite their initial misdirected fury. Farset Labs has been dealt a severe and nearly fatal financial blow, stunting its growth and preventing new equipment and services being offered to our members. In short, Latens/Pace have struck out needlessly at the voluntary technical community in Belfast and have sadly, though given the chance, made no effort to repair the consequences of, or even explain, their actions.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.34153042919933796"></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Anyone wishing to get further explanation of events, or to get in touch with the Directors of Farset Labs about this matter or otherwise should contact admin@farsetlabs.org.uk.</em></p>

<h1>Blurb</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" title="More..." src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />On Saturday the 19th of May, we are running a 24 hour overnight event where anyone with an idea, or a half-attempted project can come and share their passion with their peers.</p>
<p>FlackNite (<em>F</em>arset <em>L</em>abs h<em>ack</em>) is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events. The challenge is simple; finish a technical project or solve a problem in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work. FlackNite offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested. If you want to get involved, <em>register your interest</em> on our <a href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/flacknite" target="_blank">Digital Circle</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327741213966426/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> event, and don&#8217;t forget to <em>put any half-baked project ideas</em> onto the <a title="WIKI!!! TROLOLOLOLL" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/FlackNite" target="_blank">wiki</a> to find a team or just give someone else a good idea.</p>
<p>Also,<em> if you want to get started</em>, there is a section for Member Projects on the Farset Labs <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-members">Redmine</a> software.</p>
<p>The event will be lightly catered and every attendee is welcome to use the rest of the resources available at Farset Labs if they are not already a member. People are welcome to come and go as they please throughout the 24-hour event, and are more than welcome to bring whatever and whoever they wish to help their ideas come to reality.</p>

<p>Farset Labs is planning on running an event to introduce any person of any age to embedded programming; spanning from building your own controller board that you can take home, right up to programming it with some basic functionality. But we want to get the community&#8217;s opinion before we set anything in stone.</p>
<p>Please, take a minute of your time to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ" target="_blank">this survey</a> so we can make the best event for you.<span id="more-325"></span></p>
<p>In other news,</p>
<ul>
<li>We broke through 100 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Likes last week, and no one noticed;</li>
<li><a href="http://springup.co" target="_blank">SpringUp</a> was a fantastic success, and we welcome the winning/runner-up teams, Al.rg and betExpertise to their free memberships;</li>
<li>Our open/closed status is now listed on the <a href="http://hackerspaces.me/wall" target="_blank">Global Hackerspace Wall</a> and our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Front Page</a> (which got a little redesign last week);</li>
<li>Our trip to the <a href="http://syncni.com/news/p.php?id=6182" target="_blank">ITE Titans</a> event at <a href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">The Titanic Belfast</a> was a very interesting evening for all involved;</li>
<li>Confirmed our Charitable Status (XT33366 if anyone cares) and we secured our Rates-exempt status (making the financial future a little less foggy);</li>
<li>Rolled out our temporary online membership / donation system (donation button is over that &gt; way &gt; *hint*);</li>
<li>Set up a <a title="Wiki" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Wiki</a> to manage the internals of the space (work very much in progress);</li>
<li>Set up a <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine</a> Project Management system (again, work in progress).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all in all, it&#8217;s starting to come together.</p>
<p>In ten days we&#8217;ll close out our &#8216;Founding Member&#8217; list &#8211; on the 6th of May, Farset Labs is a month old. Every member who signed up in that time will have their name (or username, if desired [and SFW]) laser etched into a metal plate that will hang in the Labs for as long as they survive.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve been on the fence about joining, now&#8217;s the time to <a title="Membership" href="http://www.blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">sign up</a>. And remember, pop in any time* to check the place out.</p>
<p>*No, we are not 24/7 yet, just watch the <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/status.html" target="_blank">Status</a> page.</p>
