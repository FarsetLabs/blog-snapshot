										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1502" alt="Intel &amp; Farset Logos" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Intel_Farset_Logos-300x1281.png" width="300" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to publicly announcee our new corporate member&#8230; [drum roll]&#8230; <a href="http://intel.ie">Intel</a>. Welcome to the family!</p>
<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world’s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.</p>
<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel’s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.</p>
<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said “Intel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.”</p>
<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company’s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014. Any suggestions would be very welcome – what would you like to do with Intel?</p>
<p><em>This and the launch of <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">GGJ14</a> are part of this months <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Farset_Jan_News_Pack.zip" target="_blank">Press Pack</a></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Generation Innovation</h1>
<figure id="attachment_873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-873" style="width: 362px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GenerationInnovationEvent31.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-873  " title="Top entrepreneurs inspire next generation" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GenerationInnovationEvent3-1024x9531.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="337" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-873" class="wp-caption-text">Entrepreneurial students Ben Crawford, Priory College and Sarah Moore, Lismore Comprehensive School demonstrate the Nexus 7 controlled AR.Drone 2.0 to Meagan Blanton, NISP-Connect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last Night, we were invited to join NISP and a range of other sponsoring agencies to help out at the <a href="http://www.nisp.co.uk/?p=560">Generation Innovation</a> event in the Titanic Building, which is a mentor-ship and networking programme for the Next Generation of Northern Irish Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This event was not only an awful lot of fun for us (apart from nearly de-limbing a few people with the catastrophic failure of our recently donated <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">AR Drone 2.0</a> experimental platform&#8230; Sorry) but was also a great opportunity to show this brilliant young group of people what you can do with a little bit of gumption and a lot of hope, and just a little bit of enabling tech.</p>
<p>Kids from all over the province joined us, having been selected in each of their schools for being &#8216;high potential&#8217; (read: Not &#8220;Highest marks&#8221;, or &#8220;Fastest Legs&#8221;, or &#8220;Most Popular&#8221;), and we were also joined by a cavalcade of tech founders from companies big and small (somehow all three Farset Labs directors got asked to speak&#8230;), dotted across the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="Generation Innovation: Seeking Young Game-Changers for Northern Ireland" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUg1T4E_G4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>360 Production made this fantastic animation to showcase what Generation Innovation is all about.</p>
<p>But the real show stoppers were the interviews and speeches given by some epic members of the Northern Ireland Entrepreneurship Family, such as <a href="Steve Orr">Steve Orr</a> (NISP Guru In Chief), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Perry_%28game_developer%29">David Perry</a> (Gaming God), <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/technology-gadgets/generation-innovation-hunt-for-young-people-to-shape-tomorrowrsquos-world-16227814.html">Andrew Fulton</a> (Gen I  Alumnus), <a href="https://twitter.com/dannymoore_ni">Danny Moore</a> (Wombat-er, CTO NYSE Euronext, and now Lough Shore Investor) , and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannymoore_ni">Carol Fitzsimons</a> (Young Enterprise NI) which were truely inspiring to the rag-tag group of young people.</p>
<p>By my favourite bit was the Pi&#8217;s. Raspberry Pi&#8217;s</p>
<p>Each Lucky Kid was given a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> gratis. Good For Some.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to gatecrash the stage and putting this fantastic opportunity they&#8217;ve  been given, and tied it to our <a title="You did it! Our 3D printer is in the post!" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/you-did-it-our-3d-printer-is-in-the-post/">recent successful funding for our 3D Printer</a>, and said something long these lines&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_874" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-874" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/9H0A19521.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-874 " title="Bolster waxing Lyrical" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/9H0A1952-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-874" class="wp-caption-text">Me, presenting the Generation Innovation kids (and the lightning team) with a challenge!</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Technologies like 3D Printers and the Raspberry Pis you’ve received today are revolutionising the world of design and manufacture; physical prototypes take hours to produce not days. With flexible hardware and software frameworks, even the most intricate product and service ideas can be developed rapidly, tested quickly, presented immediately, and if they are failures, they&#8217;re fast failures, allowing you, as the next generation of Northern Irish Entrepreneurs, to move onto the next idea.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h1>Raspberry Jam</h1>
<figure id="attachment_864" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-864" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/whats-a-raspberry-jam/"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-864 " title="Come to a Raspberry Jam" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-22-54-3211.png" alt="" width="465" height="178" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-864" class="wp-caption-text">You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting.

<p><strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This will be Farset Labs&#8217; first Raspberry Pi centred event, and if successful, will be built into the event calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event</strong>, so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Under-18&#8217;s are welcome to attend the event accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div>
<p>Time: <a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/#">18:00, Friday 30 November</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Address: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2FMM">Farset Labs, 1 Weavers Court, Belfast, BT12 5GH</a></p>
<p>What to Bring (if you have them please bring any or all of the following, <strong>but don&#8217;t worry, we have spares so you can just bring yourself</strong>):</p>

<li>HDMI cable.</li>
<li>USB lead (Male USB A to Male Micro USB B).</li>
<li>USB mouse, USB keyboard.</li>

<p>And boy was it a wild afternoon.<span id="more-602"></span></p>
<p>Tech Camp were introduced to us several months ago by our good friend, <a title="The Man, The Legend" href="https://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> (who&#8217;s currently sunning himself on the west coast, lucky duck). We scheduled a day where the kids would come in and explore, and it was almost immediately forgotten about. Then I get an email during the week from the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/ruthebabes">Ruth Elkin</a> reminding me of what I&#8217;d let Farset Labs in for.</p>
<p>[fsg_gallery id=&#8221;3&#8243;]</p>
<p>The Level of excitement from these kids was amazing. I was expecting a flying visit with a load of bored quiet students who&#8217;d be afraid to ask questions. Not so <del>lucky</del>!</p>
<p>Seeing these teens brought back just a little bit of faith that given a few years, we can turn this province into a real innovation engine, driven by the passion for STEM and &#8216;Tinkering&#8217; that I saw, and one of the kids (epically) found one of our broken Nerf guns, asked<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/farset_labs/7780628090/in/pool-1894295@N24/lightbox/"> if he could fix it</a> (yes, we scoffed), and then, ten minutes later, shot me in the face. Legen&#8212;dary.<br />
Oh, and they pretty much destroyed our blackboard. Check out the timelapse below. I wish I had a dust mask on when I eventually wiped it down.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HQDVYJGSHQI" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>The Nerf Gun battles were Epic in their destruction, The Buzz around our Raspberry Pi&#8217;s was intense for kids who had never heard of linux before in some cases. The Fascination with our Robotic Arm (which ended up with a laser pen mounted on it</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a stranger guys! And watch this space! We&#8217;ve got a few U18 events in the pipeline (if we can keep the Insurers on side!)</p>

<p>As we creep up towards 100 Facebook likes, it&#8217;s about time that we started some proper community events on a regular basis.</p>
<p><a title="Doodle" href="http://ow.ly/apDwg" target="_blank">When do you want to have a weekly tech-get-together in the Event Space?</a></p>
<p>We want to open up the space to our community, just to chill out and chat about their working/playing week in a relaxed environment. We&#8217;ll try and provide some munchies and refreshments, as well as a few toys to experiment with.</p>
<p>Also, for anyone watching, We&#8217;ve enabled online purchasing for <a title="Membership" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/" target="_blank">Monthly Individual memberships</a>, and enabled a donation button on our <a title="Farset Labs" href="http://farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Front Page</a>, so whether you can make it down or not, it&#8217;s even easier to support what we&#8217;re trying to do here.</p>
<p>Also, incase you missed it, check out our <a title="Events" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/">Events</a> calendar for upcoming madness at Farset Labs</p>
