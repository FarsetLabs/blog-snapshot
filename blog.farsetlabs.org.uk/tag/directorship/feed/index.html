<p>What is a hackerspace?</p>



<p>Scattered around the world each one is unique and means something different to each individual member.</p>



<p>In the autumn of 2015, I first visited Farset Labs and the very same week was my first as a member. It has been almost three years, yet I still find it hard to describe Farset. What about you?</p>



<p>One thing I know is that I have been to no other place like it. A place where anyone is welcome to experiment, teach, share ideas, unjustifiably set things on fire, watch opera and everything in between.</p>



<p>In Farset I met many people that I am glad to call friends. It is because of you that I discovered so many ideas and had the opportunity to realise new-found aspirations.</p>



<p>In Farset I met people with whom I share the principles of unbiased exchange of ideas and knowledge. Together we echo the same principles to our local communities in the form of clubs, meetups and mentorship of those on earlier stages of similar paths.</p>



<p>Each year I try to make a snowballing contribution to my community through building upon the experiences of years past.</p>



<p>&#8211; Helping at charity shops taught me the value of investing time<br />&#8211; Helping at Coder Dojo, Raspberry JAM and volunteering at events taught me the value of inspiring future successors<br />&#8211; Organizing my own kids&#8217; coding club with Code Club taught me the value of reaching out to communities outside our own<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing Code Co-Op and designing programming challenges taught me the value of peership and collaboration<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing NIDevConf18 taught me the value of bringing together people with differing perspectives<br />&#8211; Most importantly, joining Farset Labs taught me the value of community</p>



<p>Over the years of I have been delighted by the impact of these actions and privileged to have responsibility over them.</p>



<p>As a director, my goal would be simple &#8211; keep alive the light of our energetic environment and preserve the welcoming community I encountered three years ago. The areas I will invest most of my time in are:</p>



<p>&#8211; introducing a wider community of active individuals to our hackerspace<br />&#8211; providing opportunities to up and coming members of our community<br />&#8211; ensuring that the space remains genuinely useful to our evolving community<br />&#8211; lighten the burden of maintenance to allow more room for efforts in growth<br />&#8211; keep our management practices in touch with the community’s sentiments and beliefs<br /><br />Our local community is bustling with life and activity &#8211; let&#8217;s show them what a hackerspace can be.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Andy Sheppard</h3>



<p>Hello there! My name is Andy. I&#8217;m one of the founding members of Farset Labs, and I&#8217;m finally here to pitch in my nomination for directorship. My main reason is that I love Farset, and really want to see it grow. I have experience in leadership, and management and all those other boring things, but I also just really love to help people.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever spoken to me, you probably already know that, but maybe not! I do tend to ramble. In fact I&#8217;m rambling right now.</p>



<p>As I said, I just want to see the place grow, and thrive, and I feel that I&#8217;d be a good person to see that happen. Once I have something planned, I do my damned best to make sure that happens!</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t spoken to me before, I&#8217;d encourage you to do so! I love to hear stories of people&#8217;s experiences, and I also just really love to talk to people. But sure, let me know!</p>



<p>Much love, and all the best, </p>



<p>Andy S</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">RON</h3>



<p>Vote to reopen nominations if you are unsatisfied with the candidates offered and wish to have the nomination period reopened to new candidates. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><strong>Update:</strong> Due to several factors outside of our control, the directors have decided to postpone this series of elections until later in the year. Thanks!</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Ben Bland for warmer shores (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua">quite literally</a>), it&#8217;s time to launch our 2015 Director Elections. Nominations will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 18th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Nominees must:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2043" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fsl-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-main.jpg" alt="Democracy!" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<ul style="color: #222222;">
<li>Nominate themselves.</li>
<li>Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</li>
<li>Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with
<ul>
<li>Their name.</li>
<li>Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</li>
<li>Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #222222;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Thursday 19th February</strong> and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 27th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous elections, available on this blog.</p>

<p>With my imminent departure for Nicaragua looming, I have the immense honour of welcoming Conor Robinson as our new incoming director, having been voted-in by the community. Conor, congratulations and welcome to the fray. I did a little air-punch when I saw that Conor had registered for election. Now Farset is getting an upgrade: replacing its most aged part with a new, faster, more functional one.</p>
<p>I have for years referred to myself as a &#8220;wannabe geek&#8221; to avoid anyone thinking that I actually know how to do anything technical. And, well, Conor&#8217;s one of those guys who does. But directing an experimental organisation like ours needs much more than tech credentials, and I think Conor brings the full set of tools to the table. He&#8217;s calm, friendly, organised (or at least he looks like he is because he&#8217;s always carrying a notebook!), and damn smart.</p>
<p>As Conor steps-up, I am stepping, well, kinda sideways. Quite a way actually. 8,341.14km in fact. I hope you will forgive my self-indulgence at taking this opportunity not only say hello to our new director, but also to offer some thoughts from a parting one. You know, like the private note the old president traditionally leaves for the new one&#8230; except it&#8217;s public. And not in the White House. And probably not as useful.<br />
<span id="more-1858"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4>Remember You&#8217;re a Director, not a Manager</h4>
<p>Your limited time in this life is priceless. Of every minute you can spare to help the cause, keep the long-term objectives in mind and try to steer this ship with nudges here and there. You&#8217;re aiming on an approximate course towards a bigger goal, rather than getting bogged-down by other people&#8217;s demands, little niggles, emptying bins, and all manner of bureaucratic chaff.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t forget the details. Sometimes they make all the difference.</p>
<p>A director, I think, should have a clear vision. I have my own idea of what Farset could and should be in future. Each of my colleagues on the team has a personal idea too. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap and no shortage of deviation. Conor, I invite you to design your own vision before you get spoiled by familiarity. Hold it close when things get messy.</p>
<h4>Reinforce The Positive</h4>
<p>When it comes to motivating people, it seems that the science stands in favour of reward over punishment. <a href="http://allpsych.com/psychology101/reinforcement.html">Positive reinforcement beats negative reinforcement</a>. So get behind those who help, shine a light on them. Incentivise and reward the pro-social, hold fast against the anti-social.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. And when something seems to work, it might have just been luck. Try to test and measure, try to understand the data. But in the end, you&#8217;ll never truly know what made the difference so don&#8217;t worry about it. When you look back <a href="http://irrco.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/why-punishment-is-better-than-praise/">the outcome was probably just Regression to the Mean</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, it&#8217;s nice to be nice.</p>
<h4>Nurture the Friendships</h4>
<p>Some high-flyers on the West Coast say that the worst thing you can do as a business founder is hire your friends. But those people will die lonely and disappointed in their overpriced homes. OK, so I&#8217;d concede that it makes sense to build a team of the best people possible and avoid nepotism on grounds of convenience or selfish aims. But I&#8217;d rather run into the unknown with people I can call in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some dear friends at Farset and now I can trust them to tell me when I&#8217;m being an idiot, without causing offence. Better still, I know they&#8217;ll cut me slack when my faults slow us down. Above all, I know I have their support, and they mine, if we go on to launch any more moonshots in the future.</p>
<h4>Hack Your Way</h4>
<p>We are constantly trying to figure-out how to make this work. Just when we get something nailed down, someone gets the bright idea to take it apart and turn it into something else. The processes, guidelines, lessons and resources, form a constantly shifting sea through which you can try to navigate but will never reach the other shore. There are best practices, not just from the global hacker/maker community (who will help if you ask them) but from wider industry and society. But sometimes you just have to deal with things when they happen. So hack the process. It&#8217;s a project in itself. And, like any good engineer, please do a better job than me at documenting your progress!</p>
<h4>And Lastly, Don&#8217;t Listen to Ben</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always advised people of this point, on which I feel quite strongly: people who have strong opinions and give confident advice probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The world is a strange, and strangely complex, complexly beautifully place. Running a venture that is novel, technologically &amp; creatively pioneering, and built on an eclectic, slightly anarchic crowd of fabulously smart and weird people, probably doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re all confident that Conor will be a great asset to the organisation and its members. He&#8217;s been on the Farset scene since it was just an idea so he knows the score. It will, I&#8217;m sure, take a little time to settle into a productive rhythm. Soon enough it will become clear where to be of most use. Everyone else will pick up the rest.</p>
<p>You know what Mitch Altman and the guys at <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">or for that matter Bill &amp; Ted</a>) would say: be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>Buena suerte Conor, y hasta luego todos mis amigos.</p>
