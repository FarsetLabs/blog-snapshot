<p>Thank you very much to everyone who has offered to donate equipment to Farset Labs &#8211; we&#8217;re very grateful, as members&#8217; generosity is what has allowed us to start.</p>
<p>However, none of it is in the space yet, so we&#8217;d like to let you know that today (Wednesday 4th April), Farset Labs will be open for the dropping off of equipment from 11am to 6pm.</p>
<p>If you need something bulky picked up, we can send out reinforcements equipped with a trailer and if these times don&#8217;t suit you, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in contact (david@farsetlabs.org.uk or eoghan@farsetlabs.org.uk) to arrange a more convenient slot.</p>
<p>We advise that you give us a heads up before you come round to Farset Labs, as we may be away for short periods doing pick-ups of bulky items, but we&#8217;ll do our best to have someone around to let people in.</p>
<p>If you would like to add your equipment to the list of donations, we&#8217;d be very grateful. To do so, fill out our short donation form at <a title="Donate to Farset" href="http://bit.ly/donatetofarset" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/donatetofarset</a></p>
