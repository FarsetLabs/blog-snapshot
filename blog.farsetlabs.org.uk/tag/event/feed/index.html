<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />
<i>Please note: </i>You must be over 18 on the 26th of January in order to participate.</p>
<p class="p1">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a> or ask us questions via <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a> </span>or <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a> with the #farsetggj18 hashtag.</p>

<p>Fail fast, fail cheap.</p>
<p>Or is it &#8220;fail fast, fail often&#8221;?</p>
<p>On Saturday, 7 Nov we&#8217;re uniting with some of our friends, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/672534676155502/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Design Salon</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thepottingshedbelfast/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Potting Shed</a>, for an all-day event, as part of the first ever <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/" target="_blank">Belfast Design Week</a>. You&#8217;re invited to join us in a creative, hands-on, welcoming environment, as we all take the journey from idea to soup.</p>
<p>Event Summary: Sat 7 Nov 2015 // 10:00 until late (12:30 – 16:00 at Farset) // Register here: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast: Makers&#8217; Day Field Trip to Farset Labs</a> // It&#8217;s all FREE OF CHARGE.</p>
<p>Yes, soup. We will begin the day at The Hive, venture over to Farset in the afternoon, then end up back at The Hive for a pitching session, while we enjoy some hot refreshment with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/belfastsoupni?fref=ts" target="_blank">Belfast Soup</a>. Mmm, soup.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll all go to the pub. Mmm, beer.</p>
<p>That Saturday of Design Week is designated as Makers&#8217; Day so roll up your sleeves and come f*@k things up with us. You don&#8217;t need to consider yourself a designer or maker to get value out of the day. It&#8217;s a good chance to make some smart, creative friends and take part in the fascinating process of developing ideas.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the planned Itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:00 – 12:00: The Potting Shed @The Hive : Bring your new or existing idea to the Potting Shed team and get their multidisciplinary input on how to make it happen or bring it to its full potential.</li>
<li>12.30: Walk from The Hive to Farset Labs.</li>
<li>13:00 – 16:00: <a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/failfast-makers-day-field-trip-to-farset-labs/" target="_blank">FailFast</a> @ Farset Labs: taking the ideas and designing prototypes to see how they might function in reality.</li>
<li>16:00: Walk back from Farset Labs to The Hive.</li>
<li>17:00 – 19:00: Belfast Soup @ The Hive: Buy some soup and pitch your ideas for the chance to win some startup money to make it happen!</li>
<li>19:00 – Collapse: Drinks at The Sunflower.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://belfastdesignweek.com/events/2015/11/7/makers-day" target="_blank">here</a> is the official page and links to register for other parts of the day.</p>
<p>For our part, we&#8217;re going to focus on that challenging step in the creative process where you have to get your idea out of your head and into the world so it can be given a chance to fail. During the workshop we&#8217;ll talk about what prototyping involves, and look at the recent revolution in rapid prototyping, assisted by technologies like 3D printers and the internet. Then we&#8217;ll stop talking and play – making simple prototypes with paper and pen and whatever we have to hand.</p>
<p>You can come to all or just part of the day&#8217;s events. Or just meet us in the pub in the evening. Mmm beer. There&#8217;s no charge but please register if you&#8217;re coming so we know the numbers. And we&#8217;re seeking techie, creative and communicative people to be in the room to help facilitate progress – please <a href="mailto:ben.m.bland@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you can help.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re calling it FailFast to resurrect an old project that never got much momentum. I guess you could say it failed, rather fast. But that&#8217;s the whole point. There&#8217;s a popular sentiment in the entrepreneurial world that failure is a big part of innovation and creativity. So much so that it has become trendy. Most ideas don&#8217;t grow into anything substantial. Most startups collapse. The important thing is to try – develop your idea, get your prototype out into the world, see if it works and iterate on its development, and do so as quickly and cheaply as possible. It will probably fail so if you want something to succeed, fail fast, fail cheap and fail often. So yeh, we&#8217;re calling it FailFast.</p>
<p>Oh, and it rhymes with Belfast. Sort of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again, where we come together and share some of the madness that we&#8217;ve been making, either in our professional or project-based lives and try to bring ourselves up from the depths of exploration to explain it to other human beings who haven&#8217;t been living and breathing this stuff. It&#8217;s also a great opportunity to pop in and see the changes made in the space recently, or just to pop in and say hello!</p>
<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a <strong>beer</strong>, soft drink, <strong>pizza</strong> and <strong>fresh fruit</strong> intermission. (Many thanks to <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10446" target="_blank">BCS Belfast</a> for sponsoring these!)</p>
<p><strong>The rules</strong> for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of<strong> 7 minutes</strong> to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li><strong>No Slides!</strong> The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic <strong>on the blackboard</strong> along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so<strong> be nice to him/her</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Punishment</strong> for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" rel="nofollow">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>

</div>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get a little social in the mean time; we&#8217;ve also got a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1471922459770954/" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> but this <strong>will not be used for attendance tracking</strong></p>

<p>Titled &#8220;Engineering Leadership for Innovation and Growth&#8221; Dr McKibben and Mr Hamilton will be speaking about the challenges facing NI&#8217;s devolved administration as we head towards rebalancing the economy, highlighting the role of both indigenous and multi-national companies in reshaping our local technology, business and educational ecosystem.</p>
<p>Hosted in QUB&#8217;s Riddel Hall by the Institution of Engineering and Technology NI Local Network, which is chaired this year by Intel Belfast&#8217;s Paul Moorhead, the April 1st event also features the opportunity to meet and network with a wide range of scientists, engineers, and technologists across the sector, as well as a drinks reception from 6pm and, our favourite thing, a buffet dinner.</p>

<p>Yes folks, 2014 is Belfast&#8217;s first year hosting a <a title="Big Data Week Belfast" href="http://bigdataweek.com/belfast/" target="_blank">Big Data Week</a>, brought to us by our buddies at <a title="Analytics Engines" href="http://analyticsengines.com" target="_blank">Analytics Engines</a>. And we have the privilege of holding the last event in the series, at 18:00 on Fri 9 May. Anyone with a techie interest is welcome. There&#8217;ll be content for all knowledge levels and of course we&#8217;ll wrap-up in good time with some beer and snacks.</p>
<p>Speakers and content are being discussed at the moment but we&#8217;ve plenty lined-up so far, from educational tutorials to a lighter take on the dark side of data. This is a good chance to learn about the big data movement and debate the validity and impact of the trend.</p>
<p>Feel free to jump in on the <a title="Big Data Week on Discourse" href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/big-data-week-at-farset-5th-9th-may/333/7" target="_blank">discussion on our Discourse forum</a> ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Other events are running at different venues between 7 and 9 May, with the main show being the Big Data Insights Conference at <a title="Titanic Belfast" href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/" target="_blank">Titanic Belfast</a> all day on the Wednesday. More at <a title="Big Data Week Belfast" href="http://bigdataweek.com/belfast/" target="_blank">Big Data Week Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>All are welcome but please <a title="Big Data in Little Farset on GetInvited" href="https://getinvited.to/benbland/big-data-in-little-farset/" target="_blank">register FREE here</a> so we know you&#8217;re coming. And watch out for the Giro D&#8217;Italia road closures, including Gt Victoria St, which you can dodge by coming over to Sandy Row. Bloody cyclists, coming here, stealing our congestion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">After a very successful event last year, Farset Labs has decided to take part for a second year in <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a>. The Game Jam will run from Friday 24th to Sunday 26th January, and is a chance to meet some great people and develop a fun game with a theme. The theme will be announced on the night, and there will be plenty of people there to team up with to create something interesting and, most importantly, to have fun!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Global Game Jam is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts,from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games For Change</a> movement.  There are already a number of <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors">sponsors</a> involved in this year’s global event, including PlayStation Mobile, Unity and Github.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009, and this year there are already over 350 individual Jam sites registered around the world. We will be live streaming video from sites all over during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see (and perhaps play) other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue, for anyone not familiar, can be found on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/jam-sites/farset-labs">listing</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry, we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! For anyone interested, this year you can list your skills ahead of the event <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhNxF3GWLga_dHJXLW43S1QwcDdYa1phWi1JVjFjUEE&amp;usp=sharing">here</a> and see what other skills and abilities participants will have. The organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams, and we have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entry to the event is free, though it is asked that you register on the Global Game Jam site if you are participating. We also have an Eventbrite listing for the event to allow people to register and give us an idea of numbers. The theme will be announced at 5pm on the Friday so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time. Looking forward to seeing you all for this, it should be a great weekend!</p>

<p dir="ltr">PS We are looking for corporate sponsorship for this event to cover venue and refreshments costs, but the event will go on regardless. If you&#8217;d be interested in helping us out, <a href="mailto:ggj@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>Members and non-members will be buying and selling things in the event space all morning.

<p>Here&#8217;s another first for the local tech community: Farset Labs is proud to announce becoming Belfast&#8217;s first and only official site for <a title="Global Game Jam – World's largest game jam event" href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>, set this year for 25-27 January. This is the biggest event of its kind in the world and brings some big name sponsors like <a title="Microsoft" href="www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a title="Facebook" href="facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a title="GitHub – Social Coding." href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Farset will be open for the full 48-hour period, as each participant team competes to build a game in a weekend. The event is being hosted in conjunction with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster Office of Innovation</a>, who will be providing refreshments so <strong>entry will be free</strong>. Belfast&#8217;s hackerspace is calling out to all kinds of creative and technical people to take part, as game development brings together the likes of writers, artists, coders, character designers, production managers and many more roles.</p>
<figure style="width: 342px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org"><img decoding="async" class="  " alt="Global Game Jam" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gobal-Game-Jam-logo.jpg" width="342" height="224" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Global Game Jam</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Global Game Jam is essentially a <a title="Hackathon – Wikipedia definition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>, focused on games of all sorts,</strong> from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a title="Games for Change – Game development for social change." href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank">Games For Change</a> movement.  We expect some exciting announcements on the day from the sponsors and organisers as to what data and platforms they&#8217;re going to let us play with, and we have plans to put some mileage on <a title="Successful crowdfunding of our new 3D printer" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/you-did-it-our-3d-printer-is-in-the-post/" target="_blank">our new 3D printer</a>.</p>
<p>The first Global Game Jam was run in 2009. Last January, 242 locations in 47 countries created over 2,000 games in one weekend to become a <a title="Global Game Jam Guinness World Record" href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/2012/03/01/global-game-jam-sets-guinness-world-record%E2%84%A2-being-largest-game-jam-world" target="_blank">Guinness World Record</a>. But sites for this year&#8217;s event have already been registered in around 300 locations in over 60 countries, so your involvement will be part of a new world record. Farset&#8217;s Andrew Bolster is the official organiser for the event in Belfast and has been collaborating with other organisations to make it a special occasion.</p>
<p>As part of the Jam, participants (or &#8216;Jammers&#8217;) will have access to a range of materials provided by corporate sponsors. The details are on the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/promotions">GGJ</a> page, but there are a few that deserve highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$100 credit</strong> on the <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> high performance cloud, a perfect place to host your online games,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coronalabs.com/">Corona Labs</a> are giving away 3 months of it&#8217;s full <strong>Indie SDK</strong>, perfect for building and hosting mobile games and social applications,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mixamo.com/">Mixamo</a>, the film-grade character animation suite with simple import and export to a range of applications including <strong>Blendr</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>, are opening up loads of toolkits for Jammers,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/">YoYo Games</a> are also giving away licenses to their<strong> GameMaker:Studio</strong> software for developing cross-platform mobile games, and finally</li>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, the heart and soul of so many developers, are giving<strong> $70 credit</strong> to each location, and we&#8217;ll be putting it up as a &#8216;Peoples Choice&#8217; prize on Sunday Evening</li>
</ul>
<p>A few key considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t need any specific skills to participate, although having a coder in your team may prove useful.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need a team. In fact, the organisers discourage the formation of teams in advance, and suggest working that out at the time.</li>
<li>A <strong>secret theme</strong> will be announced at the start, by which all the games will be influenced.</li>
<li>Kick-off will be at 17:00 on 25 January. There will be video presentations from some big industry players to get everyone going.</li>
</ul>
<p>So&#8230; maybe you&#8217;ll head down to Farset Labs to play your hand in a world event that is set to be a real game-changer.</p>
