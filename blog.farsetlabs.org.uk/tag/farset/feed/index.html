<p>With my imminent departure for Nicaragua looming, I have the immense honour of welcoming Conor Robinson as our new incoming director, having been voted-in by the community. Conor, congratulations and welcome to the fray. I did a little air-punch when I saw that Conor had registered for election. Now Farset is getting an upgrade: replacing its most aged part with a new, faster, more functional one.</p>
<p>I have for years referred to myself as a &#8220;wannabe geek&#8221; to avoid anyone thinking that I actually know how to do anything technical. And, well, Conor&#8217;s one of those guys who does. But directing an experimental organisation like ours needs much more than tech credentials, and I think Conor brings the full set of tools to the table. He&#8217;s calm, friendly, organised (or at least he looks like he is because he&#8217;s always carrying a notebook!), and damn smart.</p>
<p>As Conor steps-up, I am stepping, well, kinda sideways. Quite a way actually. 8,341.14km in fact. I hope you will forgive my self-indulgence at taking this opportunity not only say hello to our new director, but also to offer some thoughts from a parting one. You know, like the private note the old president traditionally leaves for the new one&#8230; except it&#8217;s public. And not in the White House. And probably not as useful.<br />
<span id="more-1858"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4>Remember You&#8217;re a Director, not a Manager</h4>
<p>Your limited time in this life is priceless. Of every minute you can spare to help the cause, keep the long-term objectives in mind and try to steer this ship with nudges here and there. You&#8217;re aiming on an approximate course towards a bigger goal, rather than getting bogged-down by other people&#8217;s demands, little niggles, emptying bins, and all manner of bureaucratic chaff.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t forget the details. Sometimes they make all the difference.</p>
<p>A director, I think, should have a clear vision. I have my own idea of what Farset could and should be in future. Each of my colleagues on the team has a personal idea too. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap and no shortage of deviation. Conor, I invite you to design your own vision before you get spoiled by familiarity. Hold it close when things get messy.</p>
<h4>Reinforce The Positive</h4>
<p>When it comes to motivating people, it seems that the science stands in favour of reward over punishment. <a href="http://allpsych.com/psychology101/reinforcement.html">Positive reinforcement beats negative reinforcement</a>. So get behind those who help, shine a light on them. Incentivise and reward the pro-social, hold fast against the anti-social.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. And when something seems to work, it might have just been luck. Try to test and measure, try to understand the data. But in the end, you&#8217;ll never truly know what made the difference so don&#8217;t worry about it. When you look back <a href="http://irrco.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/why-punishment-is-better-than-praise/">the outcome was probably just Regression to the Mean</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, it&#8217;s nice to be nice.</p>
<h4>Nurture the Friendships</h4>
<p>Some high-flyers on the West Coast say that the worst thing you can do as a business founder is hire your friends. But those people will die lonely and disappointed in their overpriced homes. OK, so I&#8217;d concede that it makes sense to build a team of the best people possible and avoid nepotism on grounds of convenience or selfish aims. But I&#8217;d rather run into the unknown with people I can call in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some dear friends at Farset and now I can trust them to tell me when I&#8217;m being an idiot, without causing offence. Better still, I know they&#8217;ll cut me slack when my faults slow us down. Above all, I know I have their support, and they mine, if we go on to launch any more moonshots in the future.</p>
<h4>Hack Your Way</h4>
<p>We are constantly trying to figure-out how to make this work. Just when we get something nailed down, someone gets the bright idea to take it apart and turn it into something else. The processes, guidelines, lessons and resources, form a constantly shifting sea through which you can try to navigate but will never reach the other shore. There are best practices, not just from the global hacker/maker community (who will help if you ask them) but from wider industry and society. But sometimes you just have to deal with things when they happen. So hack the process. It&#8217;s a project in itself. And, like any good engineer, please do a better job than me at documenting your progress!</p>
<h4>And Lastly, Don&#8217;t Listen to Ben</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve always advised people of this point, on which I feel quite strongly: people who have strong opinions and give confident advice probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The world is a strange, and strangely complex, complexly beautifully place. Running a venture that is novel, technologically &amp; creatively pioneering, and built on an eclectic, slightly anarchic crowd of fabulously smart and weird people, probably doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I have.</p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re all confident that Conor will be a great asset to the organisation and its members. He&#8217;s been on the Farset scene since it was just an idea so he knows the score. It will, I&#8217;m sure, take a little time to settle into a productive rhythm. Soon enough it will become clear where to be of most use. Everyone else will pick up the rest.</p>
<p>You know what Mitch Altman and the guys at <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">or for that matter Bill &amp; Ted</a>) would say: be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>Buena suerte Conor, y hasta luego todos mis amigos.</p>

<p>Summer can be either be downtime or uptime for kids, families and businesspeople alike. For our members who volunteer to run <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> at <a>Farset Labs</a> it could have been a good time to chill out. But noooooo, they&#8217;ve only gone and made more work for themselves.</p>
<p>This July and August, bring your kids to Farset Labs to learn their choice of the following, in four weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and program a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313">LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot</a>. The robot was part of the kit kindly donated to Farset by the <a href="http://nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre</a> for just this kind of hands-on learning. Well, it&#8217;s not just about the learning, right? It&#8217;s the errr&#8230;. Robots! <strong>UPDATE: LEGO sessions were booked-out in a couple of hours! Sorry. Hannah is taking names for more LEGO sessions in September, just email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></strong></li>
<li>Design a working computer game with <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>.</li>
<li>Design and build a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal CoderDojo will resume in September. See the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html">calendar for details</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand, while we have your attention, it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone that Farset has no public funding and is run by volunteers. No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/FL_DjSummer">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here</a>.</p>
<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer. I stayed up to the wee hours putting that abomination together. It&#8217;s MY abomination and I&#8217;m proud of it.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that Farset Labs will be hosting a hackathon on the weekend of the <strong>7th and 8th of December</strong>*. The event, sponsored by Liberty IT, will be held in the newly renovated Event Space in Farset.</p>
<p>The hackathon brings together like-minded, creative thinkers with their most innovative ideas. You’ll be given the weekend to work on an idea you’d like to kick-start, taking advantage of a community’s knowledge sharing, as well as equipment and resources provided by Farset. And of course, there will be plenty of food and caffeine in supply to keep your energy levels up throughout the weekend!</p>
<p>To get a feel for how we run hackathons, have a look at some of our previous ones! <a title="Global Game Jam Roundup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-roundup/">Global Game Jam</a> was extra special, but our usual <a title="New Year Lightning – Flacknite – Raspberry Jam" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/new-year-lightning-flacknite-raspberry-jam/">Flacknites</a> are a good demo of the &#8216;hands off&#8217; approach we take.</p>
<p>This year the hackathon has the feel-good theme of “<strong>Making a Difference in the Community</strong>”, so chosen ideas should ultimately be for a good cause and benefit the local community in some way. That coupled with the chance to win a <strong>prize fund of up to £1000</strong> for the most innovative ideas; there are no better reasons to sign up!</p>
<p><em>Please note: Neither Farset Labs nor event sponsors, Liberty IT, will <strong>make</strong> any claim on intellectual property generated at the event.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nominations are now closed for our Director Elections. In alphabetical order, our candidates are as follows:</p>
<h2><strong>Ben Bland</strong></h2>
<p>The maker movement is a primary axes of the current industrial revolution. So when I first met the current directors of Farset Labs, just before launch, I was eager to be involved. I could see then that a hackerspace could be a major asset for the tech community here. I introduced the directors to what is now our studio, and have aided the community’s development since. In that time the directors and several members have become good friends.</p>
<p>My offer to our community includes 12 years’ professional experience, with particular knowledge in organisational strategy, digital media, and marketing &amp; communications. My work in that time has focused on the digital, creative and tech industries, in which I’ve built a strong network of relationships with relevant people and organisations.</p>
<p>I propose to focus on the following:</p>
<p>• Increasing and diversifying the membership base.<br />
• Developing sustainable and efficient business functions.<br />
• Building relations with the wider tech and creative community.</p>
<p>My schedule will put constraints on the time I can provide but I aim to build a productive role that will enhance Farset’s position as the primary base in Northern Ireland’s maker movement.</p>
<h2><strong>Andrew Sheppard</strong></h2>
<p>I feel I would be suitable for this role, as I have experience at an executive level within a QUB society, and a director level for Q-Con. I also feel that I am suitable as I am a hard worker when it comes to it, and I can also manage my time evenly, throughout all my responsibilities.As a director I would intend to provide a fair hackerspace for all the members. I would also assist the members in making the space a more enjoyable place to work and hack.</p>
<p>My experience in Q-Con will allow me to easily make a budget, which can increase the profits in Farset Labs, while also making prices fair, reasonable and above all else, affordable.</p>
<p>While I am a novice when it comes to hacking and other activities which occur in the space, I will endeavour to help members and current directors make the space a more enjoyable place. With my lack of expertise in hacking, I can bring a new mind set to the table and along with that, new ideas and plans, which can help develop the space further.</p>
<h2><strong>Jonathan Tripathy</strong></h2>
<p>I have always loved all things electrical since a child. Whether this be radio systems (ever seen a 4 year old follow an RTE aerial installer?), computer or networking systems, I have always had a keen interests in these areas. Throughout my (now bygone) Uni days, I always had a vision of putting my skills and passions into forming a business, and thus ABPNI was born.Business Background:<br />
After (somewhat cheekily) placing leaflets on the counter in the bookshop I worked in back in 2007, ABPNI started life as a door-to-door computer repair business. After gaining contacts in the business sector (and working on their intra-site networking and software systems), I turned ABPNI&#8217;s focus towards the server hosting sector, and thus ABPNI&#8217;s Evorack division was born.What I can bring to the table for Farset:<br />
With my strong background in I.T. Infrastructure and Software, as well as my skillset obtained while being a Director of a company (dealing with Companies House and HMRC), I feel I can bring not only ideas, but also additional execution to management team at Farset, especially in relation to I.T. I also have a keen interest in teaching and would be willing to provide Masterclasses and teaching sessions to members in the fields of I.T. and Amateur Radio.<em>On the nature of Jonathan Tripathy&#8217;s current dual position as a member/corporate sponsor:</em><br />
As ABPNI/Evorack is a corporate sponsor of Farset, there may be a few times where a conflict of interest may occur. After discussions with the current management team, it was concluded that with the aid of the other 4 Directors as well as the community, these conflicts of interests can be turned into non-issues, where a satisfactory outcome is always obtained.</p>
<h2><strong>Adam Turner</strong></h2>
<p>I am standing because I believe in Farset, and want to help keep it strong into the future.</p>
<p>My key skills are passion and creativity, but I also have experience in marketing, business and management. I am also a nice, open minded and approachable person (when I’ve had a coffee).</p>
<p>Experience:</p>
<p>· Running my own digital marketing/web design company.<br />
· Committee of Politics Society and Archery Club.<br />
· Director of ICT in YE company &#8211; Won 3 awards, 2 related to IT.<br />
· Shadowed Kainos’ Marketing Director.<br />
· Marketing Placement in Employers for Childcare (included lobbying Stormont).<br />
· Early involvement in creation of Northern Ireland Youth Assembly.</p>
<p>Intention:</p>
<p>My intention is to be there to help with the running of Farset, while also helping to secure what it has already achieved and explore areas of possible growth and improvement.</p>
<p>One such area that is currently on my mind is the availability in Farset of training in core business skills for both members and the surrounding community.</p>
<h2><strong>Dylan Wylie</strong></h2>
<div>Farset Labs thus far has been a resounding success, membership is growing and our balance book is clear of the red. We have a fantastic opportunity to build upon this and achieve more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To do this I believe we must continue and expand upon the outreach work we&#8217;ve been doing so far, really push to get our name out there both within and beyond Belfast. Following this I&#8217;d like to build interest from government in what we&#8217;re doing; current legislation provides us with no public help but by showing off we can hopefully impress upon the assembly and local government the need in the community for what we&#8217;re doing.</div>
<div>
<div id=":21h" tabindex="0" role="button" data-tooltip="Hide expanded content"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/1/images/cleardot.gif" /></div>
</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>Internally I would like to spend time in making the space more presentable, while we&#8217;re never going to have it sparkling clean, vast improvements can be made with simple changes. Mainly what we need most is to increase the engagement of our membership, we need to have more of our members coming forward, making more suggestions, telling us what they like, what they don&#8217;t like and what they want changed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t consider myself to be the most qualified member for the role but I am willing to put in the time and effort that&#8217;s required. I believe I have the time, skills and enthusiasm necessary to help our next year be even better than the last.</div>
</div>
<h1><strong>Voting:</strong></h1>
<p>All current Farset members will be getting an email with a link to vote shortly. If you do not receive this email, and believe you should have, please let us know at <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>. Voting will close at midnight Saturday 23rd June.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_1121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1121" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_mjhd04Qhqm1qg6gtdo1_5001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1121" alt="NdGT, tellin' it like it is." src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_mjhd04Qhqm1qg6gtdo1_500-300x2011.jpg" width="300" height="201" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1121" class="wp-caption-text">NdGT, tellin&#8217; it like it is.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is going to sound old hat, but here at Farset, we&#8217;re all about cultivating an environment where the next generation of technologists can come into their own, but as the old saying goes, to teach is to learn twice.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we are always encouraging not only peer-teaching within the space and at Farset events, but also try and encourage our members to take part in STEM outreach to local schools.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;ve been internally working on a <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">semi-regularly-updated wiki of the STEM events that need help in Northern Ireland</a>, and hopefully, people will step up to the plate and give their time and energy to the next generation of technologists.</p>
<p>And before you say &#8220;That&#8217;s the teachers job&#8221;, just think back to your own teachers. Did they really know about the latest and greatest technologies going on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your IT teacher show you how to deploy RoR services on <a href="http://www.golygon.com/2010/11/tutorial-ruby-on-rails-hosted-on-amazon-cloud/" target="_blank">cloud based LAMP stacks</a>?</li>
<li>Did your technology teacher show you how to put an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Preliminary-SPI-on-the-Pi-Communicating-with-a-/" target="_blank">accelerometer and GPS on a Raspberry Pi </a>to act as a vehicle data logger?</li>
<li>Did your Geography teacher show you have to use GOV.UK open data resources to <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/buses/realtime.htm" target="_blank">map GIS data in real-time</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet they didn&#8217;t (obviously replace those with temporally relevant technologies&#8230;).</p>
<p>As an aside, we&#8217;re trying to find someone to fund travel expenses for such outreach, because we definitely can&#8217;t! But if you&#8217;re free at any of the listed times, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us or the listed contact points on the wiki and give back to the education system.</p>
<h1><a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Outreach_Projects" target="_blank">GO HERE AND PLEASE GIVE YOUR TIME</a></h1>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve added a few events to our calendar, accessible <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/community/events/">here</a>, so, in case you&#8217;ve missed any, we&#8217;ve got a round-up of the coming week&#8217;s festivities.</p>
<p>First up, we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/FEAST/FAMINE">FEAST/FAMINE</a> on Sunday night, kicking off at 7pm. The usual, relaxed format applies, so come down, grab a takeaway and end the week in cinematic style. Since this is our informal community movie night, it&#8217;s only open to Farset <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">members</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, we have the <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a> user group in our regular <a href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/Wildcard_User_Group">slot</a>, so, starting from 6:30pm, the Event Space will be filled with odd sounds from our resident <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/belfastcollider">experimental musicians</a>.</p>
<p>We have another Town Hall event scheduled for Saturday at 3pm, allowing members to talk to the Directors and bring up their suggestions or complaints, in personal or <a href="http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/">anonymous</a> form. The Directors will also be bringing up some important discussions and setting out the roadmap for the next few months. Farset Labs members have voting rights, so make sure to come and make your voice heard &#8211; remember, the hackerspace is run for <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>Either side of the Town Hall meeting on Saturday, we&#8217;ll be doing a spring clean, starting at around 10am. We&#8217;d <em>really</em> appreciate a hand with this, so any warm bodies would be very welcome to assist in the cleaning. We&#8217;re aiming to get the entire place spruced up, but we&#8217;re intending to pay special attention to the Workshop, making it easier to use and streamlining the Store.</p>
<p>And, of course, we have our <a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com/#">Raspberry Jam</a> event tomorrow, starting at 1pm, so we&#8217;ll see a lot of you there!</p>
<p>Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>

<p>Owned and operated by Belfast firm <a href="http://www.abpni.co.uk/" target="_blank">ABPNI Computer Solutions Ltd,</a> and run by our own member Jonny Tripathy (don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s still paying membership as well!), Evorack provides Linux and Windows virtual server hosting solutions based on the open source<a href="http://www.xen.org/products/xenhyp.html" target="_blank"> Xen Hypervisor </a>platform.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Evorack&#8217;s infrastructure and experience, Farset Labs hopes to roll-out server hosting tools to our members, enabling them to develop, test, build (and break) cool cloud apps and services.</p>
<p>With the number of new innovations in web-based apps and services having some sort of cloud back-end, it is only natural that Farset provides these resources to our members.</p>
<p>Over the next days we&#8217;ll be transferring much of our web infrastructure to Evorack, and implementing member level, private web storage, VPN, and community application servers. As with most things there may be a few hiccups&#8230; But we&#8217;ll make it through.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome on board guys!</p>

<p>Friday night saw the Event Space in Farset Labs packed with eager attendees to Northern Ireland’s first ever <a href="raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a rapidly growing global network of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> users that regularly meet and, following the success of Friday’s Jam, Farset Labs is pleased to announce that the event will be joining our wide and eclectic event calendar as a monthly fixture.<br />
With the Event Space stuffed with in excess of thirty attendees, with an age-range stretching from six to sixty and abilities ranging from the simply curious to the robot-controlling masterminds of future world-domination. In respect to the latter, one of the most impressive projects on show was the use of a Pi to control an <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-gb/default.aspx?icmp=COUKFR26MINDSTORMS" target="_blank">NXT robotics system</a>; this was from a (impressively uniformed, for 7pm) sixth form student from <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/" target="_blank">Dalriada School</a>, giving weight to the hopes of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> that their innovation will ignite the passion for tinkering and technology in schools. Of course, not only is the Pi a wonderful development system, it can also run a variety of more consumer oriented tasks; if loaded up with <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank">RaspBMC</a> software, you now have an immensely capable <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/features/raspberry-pi-media-centre-tutorial" target="_blank">£25 media centre</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-912 alignright" title="IMG_3403 (Medium)" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium-300x2001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>After the scheduled session, the assembled users had the chance to mix, compare experiences and work collaboratively, demoing, among others, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=78&amp;t=18853" target="_blank">Quake 3 running on the Pi</a> and a system for the Pi built entirely from <a href="http://www.uk.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>, including a hacked screen from an in-car entertainment system and a jury-rigged powered USB hub with connections to a keyboard, mouse and wireless card.</p>
<p>Future sessions intend to cover alternative distributions (operating systems for the Raspberry Pi), strange use cases and hardware interfacing, both via direct link and also the <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gertboard/" target="_blank">Gertboard</a>. Suffice to say, having seen the users on Friday, the road ahead will be fast, interesting and, above all, full of unexpected turnings.</p>
<p>Check out the obligatory timelapse below, which is slightly cut off due to the fact that the level of activity throughout the day filled the modest card!</p>
<p>(Apologies for the awful, awful pun, but William Cully wasn&#8217;t available for consultation at 3am.)</p>
