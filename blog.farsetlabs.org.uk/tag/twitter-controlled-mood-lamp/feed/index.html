										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you wanted to fiddle with electronics but don&#8217;t have the equipment or knowledge?<img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-682" title="Massimo Bazai" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5537363317_7ee0c04ac4-198x3001.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="180" /></p>
<p><span id="more-680"></span>Last were contacted by an Italian Maker-collective called <a title="WeFab.it" href="http://www.wefab.it/" target="_blank">WeFab.it</a>, who are associated with the fantastic <a href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> project for electronics experimentation and prototyping.</p>
<p>They were kindly letting us know about a new RS sponsored video series walking through RS&#8217;s new <a title="Arduino Starter Kit" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7617355/?" target="_blank">Arduino Starter Kit</a> (£67), presented by Arduino co-founder <a href="http://www.massimobanzi.com/" target="_blank">Massimo Banzi</a> (yes, that is his real surname).</p>
<p>On Monday, they presented their first video, &#8220;Get to know your tools&#8221;. The video explains how to build a basic circuit with the Arduino board, and how to use each of the basic components such as LEDs, switches, and resistors. So if you are new to electronics, this is a must!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2X8d_r0p92U?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a programme of 10 videos lined up, finishing up with a Twitter Controlled Mood Lamp, which we here at Farset Labs will be really interested to see, considering our occasionally depressed Nabaztag&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been walking a few of the drop-ins through similar circuits, and these videos are going to be a great resource for education. And the Starter packs look pretty darned handy too&#8230;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Depending on the community response to these videos, we&#8217;re investigating getting a few of the educational packs for the space, so if you&#8217;d be interested in this, PLEASE let us know in the comments section!</p>
