<p><strong>Experience the best Northern
Ireland has to offer from a Year in Games and meet the hardworking heroes
behind the scenes that made it happen.</strong></p>



<p>The NI Game Awards is hosted at Black
Box on Hill Street and organised by committed, enthusiastic members of the NI
tech and design community. The awards party is a fully catered event with
complementary prosecco and a wide variety of locally-made games and virtual
reality to experience. Some of the most anticipated games to come out of
Northern Ireland this year are being demoed. The categories include NI Game of the Year, NI Most
Anticipated Game, NI Game Studio of the Year, NI Rising Star, NI Community Award.</p>



<p>The awards party gives game developers, enthusiasts and
students the chance to network and socialise while celebrating the amazing
local talent of the NI game developer industry.<strong> Developers will have the chance to let people demo their
creations and get advice from some of the most experienced and talented
developers in Northern Ireland. Anyone is welcome – whether they’re interested
in creating games, or simply getting their name out there in the community. All
that is needed is </strong>a desire to
hang out and chat with other developers.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Brought to you by&nbsp;<strong>NI Game Dev Network</strong>, with
support from&nbsp;<strong>NI Screen</strong> and <strong>Farset
Labs</strong>.</p>



<p>Vote for the various categories: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/ZZeVFRfR3Y" target="_blank">bit.ly/2RsIVSg&nbsp;</a>  </p>



<p>Tickets can be booked at: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ni-game-awards-2018-tickets-54040118449">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ni-game-awards-2018-tickets-54040118449</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Additional Details</h4>



<p><strong>Dress Code</strong>, though not strictly enforced, we think such an event would be a great opportunity for us to class it up a bit and dress in black-tie. So, dig out your finest suit or dress and let’s feel fancy for the night. Monocles optional.</p>



<p><strong>Mentors&nbsp;</strong>include Unity 3D and Unreal experts, multi-award-winning developers, and multi-talented artists. This will provide you with a brilliant opportunity to get some insider tips on improving your graphics and code, getting funding and making a profit, and even on how to get your game published.</p>



<p><strong>Do you want to bring your GAME DEMO?</strong>&nbsp;That’s awesome, but please check with us in advance so we can talk about space and time. Send the organisers an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>&nbsp;for more information or ask via the Facebook group and someone will get back to you as soon as they can.</p>



<p>As the venue will be serving alcohol,&nbsp;<strong>you must be over 18 by the date of the event</strong>&nbsp;for us to be in accordance with the licensing laws. We are really sorry if this means you won’t be able to join us this time, but please do follow us to keep up to date with other events in the future.<br /><br /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Questions?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>BUS</strong>&nbsp;Customs House Square, next to Mc Hugh&#8217;s is the closest bus stop, which includes a Glider stop and is a 4 minute walk from the venue.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>TRAIN</strong>, Lanyon Place (Central Station) is the closest station to the venue and is a 16 minute walk, so leave plenty of time to catch the last train home.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>CAR</strong>, Dunbar Street and Exchange Street are the closest car parks, just 4 minutes away.</p>



<p>As per our standard, any profit or remaining finances will go to the NI Game Dev Network community, passing forward to future events and to supporting the NI game community.</p>
