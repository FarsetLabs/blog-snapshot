<h1>Project Management: 3D Printer</h1>
<p>If you want to get more involved in how the day to day operation of Farset Labs goes, including our upcoming fundraising for our 3D printer, swing over to our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine </a>to start making your mark, even if it is just reporting &#8216;bugs&#8217; with our current system.</p>
<h1><a title="FlackNite" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357">FlackNite</a>: 1400 19/05/2012</h1>
<h2>Internal Event: Members (Free), Day pass (£5)</h2>
<p>Flack (Farset Labs hACK) night is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events.</p>
<p>The challenge is simple; finish a technical project in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work.</p>
<p>Flack offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers. Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re up for it, start submitting your project ideas (or look for others to join up with) on our <a title="Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/a/ideafactory.do?id=17839&amp;mode=top&amp;discussionFilter=byids&amp;discussionID=28776" target="_blank">Ideascale</a>. If any specialist equipment or components are needed, also add them to the same &#8216;Flacknite the first&#8217; campaign.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re also looking for any talented Graphic Designers to put together a fancy pants logo for FlackNite. Please post any ideas or submissions publically on either the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">facebook page</a>, or our twitter @FarsetLabs</strong></p>
<h1>Bloc54: 1700 22/05/2012</h1>
<h2>External Event: Free</h2>
<p>The Bloc54 Games network are coming back to FL for their <a title="Digital Circle" href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/bloc54-games-network-may-meetup" target="_blank">May meeting</a>, welcome back guys. They will celebrating the release of couple more games and hopefully hearing more about games development support from InvestNI, but are welcoming visitors/walkins as well.</p>
<p>They will have 3 projectors up and running so be demo-ready!</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Demos including Zombiesaurus Games</li>
<li>Unity 3D demo</li>
<li>More in event comments</li>
</ul>
<h1>Embedded Workshop: TBC</h1>
<p>The Results (hopefully live)</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="800" src="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewanalytics?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ&amp;pli=1" width="320" height="240"></iframe></p>
<p>Make of that what you will.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be collating the results and making a decision as to the makeup and costing of the programme as soon as we get some free time (remember, volunteers with &#8216;day jobs&#8217;!)</p>
<p>If this is the first you&#8217;ve heard of this, refer back to our <a title="Planned Event: Embedded Programming; Fun with Boards" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/planned-event-embedded-programming-fun-with-boards/" target="_blank">previous post</a>!</p>

<p>Things have been moving fairly quickly (compared to the normal speed of Northern Irish progress), but it&#8217;s about time we made a public update.</p>
<p>Due to the practicalities of developing something like this, a lot of the day-to-day development of Farset Labs has been done with little publicity. This was to maintain clear communication within the launch-community and worked really well in fleshing out the ideas for the space, the community, and the projects involved.</p>
<p>Special thanks must go to the members of Queen&#8217;s University Engineering, Science and Technology Society (<a title="QUESTS" href="http://quests.society.qub.ac.uk">QUESTS</a>) for letting Farset Labs fly under their wing initially, and to <a title="Ben Bland" href="http://unblanked.com/" target="_blank">Ben Bland</a>, <a title="Eoghan Murray" href="http://twitter.com/#!/eoghanmurray" target="_blank">Eoghan Murray</a>, <a title="Matt Campbell" href="http://twitter.com/#!/just__matt" target="_blank">Matt Campbell</a>, and <a title="David Kane" href="http://www.davidkanecreative.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Kane</a>, who between them have been instrumental in getting this far.</p>
<p>Even beyond the &#8216;regular&#8217; group, there&#8217;s been a large amount of input from the community at large, through our <a title="Farset Labs Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">IdeaScale</a>, where you can vote on and submit ideas for the space, on everything from equipment purchasing to governance strategies.<span id="more-62"></span></p>
<h1>What&#8217;s been happening?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chicken-egg1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-70" title="chicken-egg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chicken-egg-300x3001.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>A significant amount of time was spent endeavouring to get local tech-business sponsorship for start-up<br />
costs and initial rental fees, but this quickly degraded into a multi-way chicken-and-egg scenario where potential sponsors wanted more plans in their preferential areas before they could commit, and we couldn&#8217;t commit since, frankly, none of us have the time or the money to mount a full-scale business proposal for something that is perfect for boot-strapping.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my <em>personal</em> belief that once we boot-strap ourselves into existence, corporate sponsors will come running to get involved in what will be the centre of the tech community in Belfast. For more info on the &#8216;Vision&#8217; for Farset Labs, see <a title="Farset Labs Vision Statement" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-vision-statement/">here</a>.</p>
<h1>So how far are we anyway?</h1>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl id="attachment_63" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 435px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=209132938352510964233.0004bb8402d1ebf03db91&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;ll=54.595589,-5.934334&amp;spn=0.017404,0.036478&amp;z=14&amp;output=embed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="350"></iframe>Those are some pretty transportation links!</dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd"></dd>

</div>
<p>Well we&#8217;re currently in final-stage negotiations with ex-Lord Mayor of Belfast, Tom Ekin, of <a title="Weavers Court Business Park" href="http://www.weaverscourt.com/" target="_blank">Weavers Court Business Park</a>, Just off Sandy Row in Belfast.</p>
<p>Weavers Court is a controlled industrial estate 3 minutes walk from Great Victoria Street Station, 15 minutes walk from Belfast City Centre, and 20 minutes walk  from UU York Street building and QUB Ashby Building.</p>
<p>Additionally, plenty of free car-parking spaces, an on site Cafe, and a whopping <a title="10gB Tibus Fibre Line" href="http://www.tibusconnect.com/about/news/item/14/super-speed-business-park-is-first-in-europe/" target="_blank">10Gb Tibus Fibre-line connection</a> with direct peering to the Hibernia Atlantic via Project Kelvin in Coleraine, giving <a title="Hibernia Atlantic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic" target="_blank">&lt;60ms latency to the Eastern Seaboard</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it a perfect location not only for the kind of technical experiments we plan on doing, but also for community outreach within both the local south-Belfast area, but also the entirety of Northern Ireland, being just two hours by train from Londonderry.</p>
<p>[fsg_gallery id=&#8221;1&#8243;]</p>
<p><strong>All being well, and pending review of the rental agreement with some associates, we should be moving in within the fortnight.</strong></p>
<h1>So What Can We Do?</h1>
<p>The space is more or less sorted, but it&#8217;s empty. We need your help to fill it while we wait for membership cashflow to buy more equipment.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard hackerspace stuff (check out the <a title="Hackerspace Electronics Lab" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Electronics_Lab" target="_blank">hackerspaces.org</a> page for examples),</li>
<li>general network and power infrastructure equipment,</li>
<li>DIY Tools and Materials,</li>
<li>Electronics tools</li>
<li>Embedded controllers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, mBed, PICAXE, etc)</li>
<li>Computers (any condition; dead ones will be turned into decorations; extremely old ones will  be turned into museum pieces)</li>
<li>Interesting tech-hardware (No, a printer doesn&#8217;t count, unless its a dot matrix <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/e189493b036abc631c15614a44070ed1.png" target="_blank">in which case&#8230;</a>)</li>
<li>Art/Decoration supplies, Paint, Brushes, rollers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything you can give, we&#8217;ll make it up to you when we get the Karma system up and running (blog post incoming about that; exciting times!)</p>
<p>The donation form should be embedded below, but some browsers have trouble with it so here&#8217;s <a title="The Great Farset Labs Donation Form" href="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDJRanJpZTlPTW9VN3VLbWtWRllibGc6MQ" target="_blank">the link</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dDJRanJpZTlPTW9VN3VLbWtWRllibGc6MQ" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="760" height="960"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ever, even if you can&#8217;t contribute any hardware to the community, please contribute your time and ideas to the <a title="Farset Labs Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">Farset Labs Ideascale</a></p>
