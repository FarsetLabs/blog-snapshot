										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After going through due process, the desk usage policy has been updated to: explicitly state that un-rented desks should be cleared after use; that members have the right to move equipment left on un-rented desks to communal storage areas; which desks are currently rented/hot-desk/communal; and implementing standard COSHH practices.<span id="more-2931"></span></p>
<p>Here at Farset Labs, we started off with a relatively simple, if comprehensive, sets of <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">Rules, Policies, and Codes of Conduct</a>, covering the use of the space, equipment in the space, and the guidelines that we as a community agree to abide to.</p>
<p>99% of these can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the space better than you found it.</li>
<li>Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sometimes it becomes necessary to be a little more explicit about the expectations of the wider community. Two issues that have been raised with the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/">management and director teams</a> occasionally but persistently since day one is &#8220;someone left a desk covered in junk, what do?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this desk rented?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://farsetlabs.slack.com/archives/C03G2CK5J/p1527063330000063">Around May time</a>, discussions in the Slack boiled up to a point where the Directorship and Management teams realised that for about a year we&#8217;d been discussing a &#8220;Clear Desk Policy&#8221; that we were absolutely sure we definitely, definitely, had one that said &#8220;clear up your stuff when your done&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oops.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>So, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koEeVoujnw3RIsW0fy_TxjXLvebNwtC0V7OWSbBGKZY/edit#heading=h.ljhyi1zcfx4r">June Town Hall</a>, I raised <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Gbpx3m7K2IdUzjPjvuPLP4QbLGaG3riKGkQPGybypQ/edit#slide=id.p">a proposal</a> to address a few simultaneous issues around &#8216;where should be clear, who should clear it, and where can I put stuff?&#8217;. This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.</p>
<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling. We have since day one had an explicit exclusion on firearms/ammunition , explosives, Offensive weapons, Unlicensed radio equipment, large quantities of combustibles, inflammables, or pressurised gases, stolen equipment, or banned substances. However, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed from the <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/commit/f90919fa0711f5e816a2f2252912d0bbd8ab4860#diff-d39a174faa68201faf0c6caaf6c912ba">old rules</a>, &#8216;large quantities&#8217; was never defined, so naturally we eventually got a couple of reports of members effectively bulk buying both high end solvents and pressurised containers on the cheap, and stashing them in boxes somewhere&#8230; So David Kane and Colin Kelsey took on the task in writing up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8u9mFUWM5no0mWuirTc53Zq5wBjiHrlaIC0Z-wNEOQ/edit">their own proposal</a> to expand and extend the coverage of our COSHH policies, that was similarly unanimously ratified at the June Town Hall.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of behind the scenes process; that doesn&#8217;t mean in &#8216;Farset Land&#8217; that the new rules came in to force; just that the community had agreed in principal to the rough outlines; the proposal still needed to be turned in to the actual changes required in the Rules, Policy&#8217;s and Codes of Conduct to bring them up to speed with the proposal; if it&#8217;s not <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/rules_and_policies.html">on the website</a> it&#8217;s not a real rule.</p>
<p>Since moving our website to <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/tree/21817e4c38c251fa5149f7cc8574e0322c8757f0">Github hosted Markdown in 2013</a>, any changes to &#8216;the rules&#8217; have been recorded and mostly Pull-Request/Reviewed as part of the ratification process in order to be as open as possible. We&#8217;re not always perfect at this but we&#8217;re getting better about being as transparent and open as possible and not just rushing through rule changes without consultation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/165">COSHH pull request</a> was relatively simple to review and merge as it was mostly technical and &#8216;edge case&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/pull/164">Desk Rental pull request</a> was a bit more complex, with members of the community collaborating and beating out the policy changes to cover any edge cases, and was signed off on at last nights&#8217; Town Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant&#8221; changes in this policy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently-Rented Hot-Desks, are indicated as in red on the <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html">Facilities page</a>, and it is the responsibility of the Directors and NEMs to keep this up to date.</li>
<li>Any desks labeled in green in the facilities diagram are available for Rental</li>
<li>All Green and Blue desks are subject to a clear desk policy, which means these desks must be cleared of all equipment (on or under) before leaving the space</li>
<li>Any equipment left unattended at such desks can be moved by any member to common storage facilities.</li>
<li>Two desks in the workshop are being opened up to being rented.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to thank the members who made it out last week to blitz and &#8220;defrag&#8221; the whole space; it&#8217;s survived a week without turning back in to a tip which is always a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="VID 20180730 WA0003 2" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQMmesROYK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s a little notification/story from the governance of Farset; as a reminder, Town Halls are held on the first Monday of the month in the Event Space at 7pm and are open to both members and interested-non members (however non-members can&#8217;t vote). A lot of Farsets&#8217; day-to-day governance <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">is handled in our Slack</a>, which, again, is open to both members and non-members.</p>
<p>If there are any questions or ideas about how governance is handled, we&#8217;re more than happy for those to be discussed publicly on Github or Slack, or privately by emailing info@farsetlabs.org.uk, or admin@farsetlabs.org.uk if there is something sensitive to be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a closely fought race between <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/election-2015-ballot/">Pip and Ron</a> but in the end, the community rallied behind Pip to help bring her vision to the leadership at Farset Labs.</p>
<p>When I hassled her for comment, this is what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheers to all who got involved in the recent election. I&#8217;m delighted to have been voted in, and am looking forward to getting my hands dirty to help keep Farset an excellent place.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can check out what Pip&#8217;s all about on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/" target="_blank">her website</a>.</p>
<p>PS The entire Farset Labs community would also like to congratulate Pip and her partner on their recently completed adoption, there are no two better people for it, and we wish you and your new family all the best!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>
