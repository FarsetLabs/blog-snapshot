<p><strong>Experience the best Northern
Ireland has to offer from a Year in Games and meet the hardworking heroes
behind the scenes that made it happen.</strong></p>



<p>The NI Game Awards is hosted at Black
Box on Hill Street and organised by committed, enthusiastic members of the NI
tech and design community. The awards party is a fully catered event with
complementary prosecco and a wide variety of locally-made games and virtual
reality to experience. Some of the most anticipated games to come out of
Northern Ireland this year are being demoed. The categories include NI Game of the Year, NI Most
Anticipated Game, NI Game Studio of the Year, NI Rising Star, NI Community Award.</p>



<p>The awards party gives game developers, enthusiasts and
students the chance to network and socialise while celebrating the amazing
local talent of the NI game developer industry.<strong> Developers will have the chance to let people demo their
creations and get advice from some of the most experienced and talented
developers in Northern Ireland. Anyone is welcome – whether they’re interested
in creating games, or simply getting their name out there in the community. All
that is needed is </strong>a desire to
hang out and chat with other developers.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Brought to you by&nbsp;<strong>NI Game Dev Network</strong>, with
support from&nbsp;<strong>NI Screen</strong> and <strong>Farset
Labs</strong>.</p>



<p>Vote for the various categories: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/ZZeVFRfR3Y" target="_blank">bit.ly/2RsIVSg&nbsp;</a>  </p>



<p>Tickets can be booked at: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ni-game-awards-2018-tickets-54040118449">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ni-game-awards-2018-tickets-54040118449</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Additional Details</h4>



<p><strong>Dress Code</strong>, though not strictly enforced, we think such an event would be a great opportunity for us to class it up a bit and dress in black-tie. So, dig out your finest suit or dress and let’s feel fancy for the night. Monocles optional.</p>



<p><strong>Mentors&nbsp;</strong>include Unity 3D and Unreal experts, multi-award-winning developers, and multi-talented artists. This will provide you with a brilliant opportunity to get some insider tips on improving your graphics and code, getting funding and making a profit, and even on how to get your game published.</p>



<p><strong>Do you want to bring your GAME DEMO?</strong>&nbsp;That’s awesome, but please check with us in advance so we can talk about space and time. Send the organisers an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>&nbsp;for more information or ask via the Facebook group and someone will get back to you as soon as they can.</p>



<p>As the venue will be serving alcohol,&nbsp;<strong>you must be over 18 by the date of the event</strong>&nbsp;for us to be in accordance with the licensing laws. We are really sorry if this means you won’t be able to join us this time, but please do follow us to keep up to date with other events in the future.<br /><br /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Questions?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>BUS</strong>&nbsp;Customs House Square, next to Mc Hugh&#8217;s is the closest bus stop, which includes a Glider stop and is a 4 minute walk from the venue.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>TRAIN</strong>, Lanyon Place (Central Station) is the closest station to the venue and is a 16 minute walk, so leave plenty of time to catch the last train home.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re travelling by&nbsp;<strong>CAR</strong>, Dunbar Street and Exchange Street are the closest car parks, just 4 minutes away.</p>



<p>As per our standard, any profit or remaining finances will go to the NI Game Dev Network community, passing forward to future events and to supporting the NI game community.</p>



<p>For any more information or if you have any questions about attending/demoing at the event, please contact <u>events@farsetlabs.org.uk</u></p>

<p class="p1">Global Game Jam is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">hackathon</span></a> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">Games For Change</span></a> movement. There are already a number of large <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">sponsors</span></a> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 500 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">2013</span></a>. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="s1">listing</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.<br />

<p><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Farset Labs is back again in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The Game Jam will run <strong>from </strong></span><strong>Friday 29th to Sunday 31st January</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and is a chance to meet some great people and develop a fun game in a weekend.  With a party atmosphere from Friday night, there will be plenty of people there to team up with, create something interesting and, most importantly, to have fun!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cwilgar/16397962172/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/cwilgar/16397962172/</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s jam was a great success, with our highest jammer count yet!</span><span id="more-2673"></span></p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Update: The Night Before Game-Jam<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">We&#8217;ll be kicking off <strong>GGJ Belfast</strong> in just over 24hrs folks! The official kick-off, introduction and keynote will begin at <strong>5pm on Friday</strong>. We&#8217;ll be open a couple of hours before that, so everyone is welcome to come down early to set up and socialise with your fellow jammers!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">So everyone can get into making their games straight away, we also recommend that you download any software you might find useful <strong>before</strong> getting to Farset Labs (or make sure you have the latest updates) particularly if you&#8217;re planning to use packages like Photoshop, Unity or similar software. There&#8217;s a list of resources here: <a style="color: #008000;" href="http://globalgamejam.org/jammer-resources" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://globalgamejam.org/jammer-resources</a> including some useful tips and a few free bonuses for jammers taking part.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">We look forward to seeing you all tomorrow!</span></p>
<hr />
<p><b>How do I enter?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask that you reserve your seat at <strong>Farset Labs</strong> using GetInvited here: </span><a href="https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/global-game-jam-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://getinvited.to/farsetlabs/global-game-jam-2016/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then complete your <strong>Global Game Jam</strong> registration at </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://globalgamejam.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on (or before) Friday 29th January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Jams are often oversubscribed; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is free, and all meals are catered!  The game jam’s theme will be announced at </span><b>5pm on Friday 29th January</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so we recommend all participants to be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on. We look forward to seeing you all, as it will be a great weekend!</span></p>
<h4><b>What do I need?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams.  We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or ask us questions via our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts">Facebook</a> page</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or our </span><a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the #GGJ16 tag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again brought to you to in partnership with <a href="http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk">Northern Ireland Screen</a>.</span></p>

<p><b>What is Global Game Jam?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Game Jam is a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as non-digital productions like board and card games. Some will be frivolous, others developed for solid causes, such as social impact in the case of the </span><a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games For Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement.  There are already a number of large </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in this year’s global event, including Facebook, Unity and Github.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Global Game Jam ran in 2009, and this year there are already over 480 individual Jam sites registered around the world, and Farset Labs has been running Northern Ireland’s only public GGJ site since </span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the 48hr event. There will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our Global Game Jam </span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/farset-labs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>Summer can be either be downtime or uptime for kids, families and businesspeople alike. For our members who volunteer to run <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> at <a>Farset Labs</a> it could have been a good time to chill out. But noooooo, they&#8217;ve only gone and made more work for themselves.</p>
<p>This July and August, bring your kids to Farset Labs to learn their choice of the following, in four weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and program a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313">LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot</a>. The robot was part of the kit kindly donated to Farset by the <a href="http://nervecentre.org/">Nerve Centre</a> for just this kind of hands-on learning. Well, it&#8217;s not just about the learning, right? It&#8217;s the errr&#8230;. Robots! <strong>UPDATE: LEGO sessions were booked-out in a couple of hours! Sorry. Hannah is taking names for more LEGO sessions in September, just email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></strong></li>
<li>Design a working computer game with <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>.</li>
<li>Design and build a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal CoderDojo will resume in September. See the <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/index.html">calendar for details</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand, while we have your attention, it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone that Farset has no public funding and is run by volunteers. No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/FL_DjSummer">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here</a>.</p>
<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer. I stayed up to the wee hours putting that abomination together. It&#8217;s MY abomination and I&#8217;m proud of it.</i></p>
