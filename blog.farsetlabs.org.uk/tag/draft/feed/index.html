<p>Owned and operated by Belfast firm <a href="http://www.abpni.co.uk/" target="_blank">ABPNI Computer Solutions Ltd,</a> and run by our own member Jonny Tripathy (don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s still paying membership as well!), Evorack provides Linux and Windows virtual server hosting solutions based on the open source<a href="http://www.xen.org/products/xenhyp.html" target="_blank"> Xen Hypervisor </a>platform.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Evorack&#8217;s infrastructure and experience, Farset Labs hopes to roll-out server hosting tools to our members, enabling them to develop, test, build (and break) cool cloud apps and services.</p>
<p>With the number of new innovations in web-based apps and services having some sort of cloud back-end, it is only natural that Farset provides these resources to our members.</p>
<p>Over the next days we&#8217;ll be transferring much of our web infrastructure to Evorack, and implementing member level, private web storage, VPN, and community application servers. As with most things there may be a few hiccups&#8230; But we&#8217;ll make it through.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome on board guys!</p>

<p>Friday night saw the Event Space in Farset Labs packed with eager attendees to Northern Ireland’s first ever <a href="raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/" target="_blank">Raspberry Jam</a>.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a rapidly growing global network of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> users that regularly meet and, following the success of Friday’s Jam, Farset Labs is pleased to announce that the event will be joining our wide and eclectic event calendar as a monthly fixture.<br />
With the Event Space stuffed with in excess of thirty attendees, with an age-range stretching from six to sixty and abilities ranging from the simply curious to the robot-controlling masterminds of future world-domination. In respect to the latter, one of the most impressive projects on show was the use of a Pi to control an <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-gb/default.aspx?icmp=COUKFR26MINDSTORMS" target="_blank">NXT robotics system</a>; this was from a (impressively uniformed, for 7pm) sixth form student from <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/" target="_blank">Dalriada School</a>, giving weight to the hopes of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> that their innovation will ignite the passion for tinkering and technology in schools. Of course, not only is the Pi a wonderful development system, it can also run a variety of more consumer oriented tasks; if loaded up with <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank">RaspBMC</a> software, you now have an immensely capable <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/features/raspberry-pi-media-centre-tutorial" target="_blank">£25 media centre</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-912 alignright" title="IMG_3403 (Medium)" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_3403-Medium-300x2001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>After the scheduled session, the assembled users had the chance to mix, compare experiences and work collaboratively, demoing, among others, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=78&amp;t=18853" target="_blank">Quake 3 running on the Pi</a> and a system for the Pi built entirely from <a href="http://www.uk.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>, including a hacked screen from an in-car entertainment system and a jury-rigged powered USB hub with connections to a keyboard, mouse and wireless card.</p>
<p>Future sessions intend to cover alternative distributions (operating systems for the Raspberry Pi), strange use cases and hardware interfacing, both via direct link and also the <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gertboard/" target="_blank">Gertboard</a>. Suffice to say, having seen the users on Friday, the road ahead will be fast, interesting and, above all, full of unexpected turnings.</p>
<p>Check out the obligatory timelapse below, which is slightly cut off due to the fact that the level of activity throughout the day filled the modest card!</p>
<p>(Apologies for the awful, awful pun, but William Cully wasn&#8217;t available for consultation at 3am.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Generation Innovation</h1>
<figure id="attachment_873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-873" style="width: 362px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GenerationInnovationEvent31.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-873  " title="Top entrepreneurs inspire next generation" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GenerationInnovationEvent3-1024x9531.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="337" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-873" class="wp-caption-text">Entrepreneurial students Ben Crawford, Priory College and Sarah Moore, Lismore Comprehensive School demonstrate the Nexus 7 controlled AR.Drone 2.0 to Meagan Blanton, NISP-Connect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last Night, we were invited to join NISP and a range of other sponsoring agencies to help out at the <a href="http://www.nisp.co.uk/?p=560">Generation Innovation</a> event in the Titanic Building, which is a mentor-ship and networking programme for the Next Generation of Northern Irish Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This event was not only an awful lot of fun for us (apart from nearly de-limbing a few people with the catastrophic failure of our recently donated <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">AR Drone 2.0</a> experimental platform&#8230; Sorry) but was also a great opportunity to show this brilliant young group of people what you can do with a little bit of gumption and a lot of hope, and just a little bit of enabling tech.</p>
<p>Kids from all over the province joined us, having been selected in each of their schools for being &#8216;high potential&#8217; (read: Not &#8220;Highest marks&#8221;, or &#8220;Fastest Legs&#8221;, or &#8220;Most Popular&#8221;), and we were also joined by a cavalcade of tech founders from companies big and small (somehow all three Farset Labs directors got asked to speak&#8230;), dotted across the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="Generation Innovation: Seeking Young Game-Changers for Northern Ireland" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUg1T4E_G4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>360 Production made this fantastic animation to showcase what Generation Innovation is all about.</p>
<p>But the real show stoppers were the interviews and speeches given by some epic members of the Northern Ireland Entrepreneurship Family, such as <a href="Steve Orr">Steve Orr</a> (NISP Guru In Chief), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Perry_%28game_developer%29">David Perry</a> (Gaming God), <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/technology-gadgets/generation-innovation-hunt-for-young-people-to-shape-tomorrowrsquos-world-16227814.html">Andrew Fulton</a> (Gen I  Alumnus), <a href="https://twitter.com/dannymoore_ni">Danny Moore</a> (Wombat-er, CTO NYSE Euronext, and now Lough Shore Investor) , and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannymoore_ni">Carol Fitzsimons</a> (Young Enterprise NI) which were truely inspiring to the rag-tag group of young people.</p>
<p>By my favourite bit was the Pi&#8217;s. Raspberry Pi&#8217;s</p>
<p>Each Lucky Kid was given a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> gratis. Good For Some.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to gatecrash the stage and putting this fantastic opportunity they&#8217;ve  been given, and tied it to our <a title="You did it! Our 3D printer is in the post!" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/you-did-it-our-3d-printer-is-in-the-post/">recent successful funding for our 3D Printer</a>, and said something long these lines&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Technologies like 3D Printers and the Raspberry Pis you’ve received today are revolutionising the world of design and manufacture; physical prototypes take hours to produce not days. With flexible hardware and software frameworks, even the most intricate product and service ideas can be developed rapidly, tested quickly, presented immediately, and if they are failures, they&#8217;re fast failures, allowing you, as the next generation of Northern Irish Entrepreneurs, to move onto the next idea.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h1>Raspberry Jam</h1>
<figure id="attachment_864" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-864" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/whats-a-raspberry-jam/"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-864 " title="Come to a Raspberry Jam" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-22-54-3211.png" alt="" width="465" height="178" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-864" class="wp-caption-text">You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting.

<p><strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their Raspberry Pi to good use. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This will be Farset Labs&#8217; first Raspberry Pi centred event, and if successful, will be built into the event calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event</strong>, so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Under-18&#8217;s are welcome to attend the event accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div>
<p>Time: <a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/#">18:00, Friday 30 November</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Address: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2FMM">Farset Labs, 1 Weavers Court, Belfast, BT12 5GH</a></p>
<p>What to Bring (if you have them please bring any or all of the following, <strong>but don&#8217;t worry, we have spares so you can just bring yourself</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Laptop.</li>
<li>HDMI cable.</li>
<li>USB lead (Male USB A to Male Micro USB B).</li>
<li>USB mouse, USB keyboard.</li>
<li>Computer monitor with HDMI input.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THIS EVENT IS IN HIGH DEMAND SO PLEASE BOOK AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our long and exciting <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume campaign</a> is finally over, and there is evidently plenty of support for a 3D printer within the space &#8211; we raised over £100 extra by the time the fundraiser was finished. In the time that it ran, we saw very evident spikes and patterns, which coincided nicely with various announcements and media publishers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg1.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-853" title="oimg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg-300x1851.png" alt="Breakdown of rewards" width="300" height="185" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-853" class="wp-caption-text">Breakdown of donators by which reward they chose</figcaption></figure>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who helped get the word out about the campaign, and would especially like to thank every single person who backed the Sponsume appeal. Even now we are getting occasional offers from people who want to chip in a little more towards consumables. We hope that everyone that donated enjoys their rewards, which will be sent out in the following weeks after they are all organised and produced.</p>
<p>Once the custom print rewards are finished, the 3D printer will be open for every member of Farset Labs to access whenever they wish. Significant quantities of PLA and ABS plastic have been ordered, and this is open for all members to use in small-scale production. Anyone wishing to make lots of models or make very big items is requested to play fair and <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">buy their own plastic</a>, or donate towards getting more for the space. Apart from that, there are absolutely no restrictions on use, and we look forward to seeing what people make with the machine.</p>
<p>The Ultimaker is <strong>now in the post</strong>, and is expected within around a week. Announcements will be made when it arrives, and everyone involved in the fundraiser and purchase will be invited down to build and be the first to use it.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone that helped. Thanks to you, we now have a fantastic tool to make Farset Labs a much more useful and interesting place.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Farset Labs has gone from strength to strength since opening its doors in April of this year, and the community has grown and matured quickly, but our summer progress was slower than was hoped for. Our entire model and ethos is built on transparency and democracy, so we publish this document to explain to our membership and supporters the difficulties placed in our path due to litigation launched by Latens/Pace plc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of the blue, on the 14th June, multiple copies of <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Letter-to-Farset-Labs-14th-June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> were hand delivered to Farset Labs by Pinsent Masons, legal representatives of Latens/Pace, as well as emailed to several different accounts of the Directors whether they were Farset Labs related or personal, work and university inboxes. One of our members had been accused on their last day of work of stealing sensitive Confidential Information from their employer and transmitting it to Farset Labs. The letter explained that we had possession of their property, and that it it was on our equipment. It demanded that we exclude an allegedly-involved member from the premises and cut all communication with him pending completion of their investigations. Two of the Directors have known the member for almost a decade, having gone to the same school, and so for a demand to come through to sever all contact was seen to be unreasonable.<span id="more-731"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the demands of the letter were not finished, but became unfeasible. We were required to provide ‘confirmation by return’ that third party computer specialists hired by Latens/Pace would be allowed unfettered access to the premises and all equipment to forensically image the equipment and ‘assess any other use of such equipment in relation to the Confidential Information’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final demand was for us to undertake that, by 4pm the next day, any Confidential Information in our control would not be used or shared, but returned to Latens or destroyed at their option. We were happy to comply with this one, since we were safe in the knowledge that we didn’t have any of these supposed trade secrets.&nbsp;The letter then finished by informing the Directors of their possibly criminal liability in failing to return the stolen information and in handling stolen goods.. This was a difficulty, given that we had no stolen information to return. However, curiously for a supposed crime of this magnitude, Latens had elected not to involve the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our reply addressed all the points, but we paid particular attention to the third demand (forensically imaging all equipment), pointing out that, if we assisted Latens in imaging members’ personal laptops and other devices on the premises, we really would be handling stolen goods this time around, as well as committing several acts under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We were very firm in disagreeing with Latens/Pace on this point. We also elected to continue our usual contact with the member, given that we had seen no evidence so far of any theft of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the Directors had <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Eoghan-Murray-Latens-14.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters</a> delivered to their places of work reminding us of our ‘liability as an officer of the company for offences by the company under the Fraud Act 2006’ and to be ‘aware that there are sanctions in place under the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 with regard to the making of false statements with intent to deceive by company directors’.&nbsp;Not only is it, in our opinion, a defamation of character to be served by a legal aide in front of colleagues, we feel that this action was bordering on harassment and caused distress to us, given we were being threatened with the possibility of criminal prosecution in relation to an event that we had been first made aware of when a flurry of identical emails had landed in every inbox we had, whether or not the inbox was related to Farset Labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We felt we had no option but to seek legal advice and responded via our solicitors from this point onwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pinsent Masons then sent through a <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Farset_Labs_-undertakings_19_6_12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list of undertakings</a> required by them. All through this, immense pressure was put on the Directors to sign various documents within hours, with no real time to consult counsel or other authorities. We did not bow to these pressures, but it began to affect our running of Farset Labs and our everyday work and academic activities.&nbsp;Among these undertakings, key points included: provision of the network architecture within Farset and storage of electronic information; security arrangements within Farset Labs; and a provision of a log of the time, size and description of any electronic information flow from Latens to Farset.&nbsp;We then spent valuable time and effort trying to make Pinsent Masons understand that our front-end router does not log that information, so it was simply impossible for us to provide it, but the replies generally just quoted the same demands again and again.&nbsp;Several emails went back and forth, eating up time and money, before we finally got <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Revised-Undertakings-27.06.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of the undertakings</a> provided to us that would be possible for us to sign. We signed this and returned it, hoping that it would bring the situation to a conclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sadly, if anything, it got even more disjointed and difficult. Despite our repeated offers of a face-to-face meeting with Latens to help try and resolve the situation, the responses from Pinsent Masons ignored these, never mentioning them. The demands became more warped, sometimes making little sense. One of our personal favourites was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong><em>Answer 1.3(a) – Please confirm if the metal project boxes are lockable whilst also on&nbsp;the network when in the boxes.</em></strong></p>
<p>We assure you that this has <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ltr-to-Adam-Curry-Mills-Selig-enc-revised-undertakings-16.07.12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not been taken out of context</a> in any way. None of the Directors of Farset nor our legal team could make sense of this and, at this stage, with the blessing of our solicitor, we informed Pinsent Masons that we would not be communicating further, as the requests had become repetitive, spurious and, we suspected, simply an attempt to harass us. We were also advised that, had Latens truly thought a breach had taken place, they would have collected evidence and brought all parties involved to court long before now or, at the very least, involved the PSNI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We then learned that the Latens personnel handling the Pinsent Masons team had gone on holiday towards the end of this, such was the severity, urgency and threat of this terrible crisis. This also explained why the technical acumen in the responses to our explanations was lacking. The net result of this experience was that we had lost time and sleep over a non-issue, mainly due to the extremely poor handling of the matter by Latens/Pace and their lawyers at Pinsent Masons. We have also been left with a gaping four-figure hole in our already-limited budget from legal expenses, which has threatened the very existence of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>After several months of silence from Pinsent Masons, we sent a letter via recorded delivery to the CEO of Pace detailing these events and the insanity of the entire episode, inviting comment and possibly aid, but have had no response, despite a follow-up phone call and ample time.<br />
In conclusion, the company and its Directors have been dragged through hell for no reason in a case that Latens/Pace now appear to have lost interest in, despite their initial misdirected fury. Farset Labs has been dealt a severe and nearly fatal financial blow, stunting its growth and preventing new equipment and services being offered to our members. In short, Latens/Pace have struck out needlessly at the voluntary technical community in Belfast and have sadly, though given the chance, made no effort to repair the consequences of, or even explain, their actions.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.34153042919933796"></strong></p>

<h1>3D Printer Updates</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image91.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-725" title="image9" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/image9-300x3001.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>We&#8217;re all amazed and humbled by the support being given to the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer" target="_blank">3D printing Fundraiser</a>. We&#8217;re proud to be the first &#8216;Technology&#8217; entry on Sponsume, and we&#8217;re so very nearly there you can almost taste it.</p>
<p>In terms of some of the awesome ways people are planning to use the printer, some have really stuck in my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatrical set design models for lightning tests,</li>
<li>Architectural prototyping,</li>
<li>Customised Bow Riser (Handles) for Archers</li>
<li>CCTV Camera Camouflage</li>
<li>3D Printed 3D Scanner (3D-Ception&#8230;?)</li>
</ul>
<div>And it goes without saying that the mad group that is &#8216;our community&#8217; are going to come up with more crazy and strange ways to experiment with the new hardware.</div>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching Farset from the outside, now is a brilliant time to get involved; the top two tiers of donation include a year&#8217;s Enthusiast and Freelance membership respectively.</p>
<p>With 8 days to go and just under £300 to find, if you haven&#8217;t already, please consider making a donation, and you&#8217;ll get <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/reward/2924" target="_blank">cool stuff</a> in return.</p>
<h1>Town Hall</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-503767/Big-Brother-Britain-How-earn-Are-gay-Town-Hall-chiefs-ordered-out.html"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-724" title="townhallDM2012_468x351" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/townhallDM2012_468x351-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Last <a title="Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event/" target="_blank">Town Hall meeting</a> was in late September, and it&#8217;s high time, given the changes ad improvements in the space since then, that we all had a face to face chat.</p>
<p>As such, we&#8217;re going to have a Town Hall meeting booked this coming Friday between 5:30 and 7:00. It&#8217;s hopefully not going to take that long to sort everything out.</p>
<p>On the agenda at the minute (if you want to add anything, let us know in one of the many ways):</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Update</li>
<li>3D Printer Update / Purchasing / Consumable Selection (i.e., if you want to pick the colours of the 3D printer, come to this meeting!)</li>
<li>Potential Project Funding ideas</li>
<li>Equipment rollout (Workshop)</li>
<li>Establishment of Training for members in how to use the space / Health and Safety</li>
<li>AOB (All other business / opportunity to rant)</li>
</ul>
<h1> Flack-Lite?</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-723" title="spamlite" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spamlite1.png" alt="" width="228" height="234" /></a>Since this holiday season is a bit heavy on the tech-events, such as the brilliant  <a href="http://2012.buildconf.com/" target="_blank">Buildconf</a> this week (Good Luck <a href="https://twitter.com/andymcmillan" target="_blank">Andy</a>!), Kainos&#8217; <a href="http://www.healthhackni.com/home.html" target="_blank">HealthHackNI</a> in the city hall in early December, and the wealth of &#8216;Office Nights Out&#8217;, we decided that there&#8217;s little point in scraping together another Full Blown Flacknite before &#8217;13.</p>
<p>So instead, we&#8217;re going to have a casual, BYOPizza <strong>Flack-Lite</strong> weekend, where the space will be open to all, and the theme will be improving Farset Labs&#8217; infrastructure.</p>
<p>Current projects in the todo list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Membership Management</li>
<li>Redo Website</li>
<li>Improve door control (and possibly a proper app!)</li>
<li>Improve FarBot to be smarter</li>
<li>Exposing *something* from the CCTV system to the membership</li>
<li>Building Time-Lapse table for the 3D Printer</li>
</ul>
<div>And More I&#8217;m sure will come to us.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There will be the usual selection of muchies and drinks, but these will be paid for from the community fund, so please, either BYO or make a representative donation.</div>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll have a great deal of awesome projects to show  next week, or at least will have moved along some of our more stubborn issues.</p>
<h1>User Groups</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-722" title="icon.supercollider" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/icon.supercollider1.gif" alt="" width="62" height="63" /></a>We currently have a full roster of User Groups this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>14th: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> (Algorithmic Music Generation)</li>
<li>21st: <a href="http://belfastjs.org/" target="_blank">BelfastJS</a> (JavaScript, currently with Arduino and Cars)</li>
<li>28th: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/belfastlinux" target="_blank">BLUG</a> (Everything Linux and Open Source)</li>
<li>5th: <a href="https://twitter.com/PyBelfast" target="_blank">PyBelfast</a> (Python, possibly something Raspberry Related, see below)</li>
</ul>
<div>Since we&#8217;re now technically &#8216;At Capacity&#8217;, if any other user groups want to run, we&#8217;ll shuffle things around to try and be fair to everyone, and this will be on a case by case basis.</div>
<h1>Raspberry Jam</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-721" title="cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.16" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cropped-Screen-Shot-2012-11-02-at-17.11.161.png" alt="" width="800" height="116" /></a><a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">On Thursday the 29th, we&#8217;re hosting a Raspberry Jam.</a></p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Jam</strong> is a rapidly growing global network of user groups that meet every month to support hobbyists, developers, teachers, students, children and families – in fact, anybody that would like to put their <strong>Raspberry Pi to good use</strong>. While Raspberry Jam is not endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services, some of our regular members are volunteers for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. At our meetings we have helpful people who can help you with everything you need to get what you want from your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This will be Farset Labs&#8217; first Raspberry Pi centred event, and if successful, will be built into the event calendar.</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a<strong> Farset Labs Members event,</strong> so visitors will be expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, but please try and BYO monitor. We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://fsl-pijam.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"><strong>This event is in high demand so please book ahead of time to avoid disappointment</strong></a></div>
<h1>And Finally: NI Tech Show</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-726" title="the-tech-show-art" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-tech-show-art1.png" alt="" width="142" height="142" /></a>Light one to finish things off.</p>
<p>I was invited onto the #<a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/category/tech/the-tech-show/" target="_blank">NITechShow</a> podcast last week leading to one of the <a href="http://eamonnmallie.com/2012/11/tech-show-podcast-episode-26/" target="_blank">longest editions</a> that Chris or Matt have done recently (sorry guys) covering a fair amount of the local and global tech news, including the Good the Bad and the Ugly of Microsoft software and hardware (specifically my clicky keyboard), Geeky Christmas gifts for kids (and big kids), a load of events coming up in the NI area, and a big &#8216;ol rant from me about Farset Labs right at the end.</p>

Bobbie flew over from Brighton specifically for the two-hour event, and landed mid-morning in the George Best Belfast City Airport. After some breakfast, he and those at Farset settled into setting up for the event.</p>
<p>The talk kicked off at 4pm with an interested crowd engaging in the two-hour-long interactive talk, with many asking questions, particularly on Bobbie&#8217;s challenges he had faced. Specifically, Mr Johnson spoke about his Kickstarter success with Matter and the process that shaped it, particularly the viral nature of the fundraising campaign. He spoke of how the majority of the money was raised in under 36 hours, leaving much more time to work on the final product.</p>
<p>Matter is a soon-to-be-released online publication for long-form journalism and in-depth reporting. Hopefully pumping four stories out per month eventually, it aims to replicate the investigative meat of a print magazine but with a more granular purchasing mechanism allowing readers to buy what they want to read and no more; signal-to-noise improvement, as it were. It is set to launch soon with one long story, with more being added regularly to produce a regular stream of content.</p>
<p>The talk continued with more questions probing the need for such a service, to which Bobbie answered that he and his team had decided to do it just because no-one else had, and to test the model. Questions continued for around an hour afterwards and the group broke up shortly afterwards, after several one-on-one discussions and some networking.</p>
<p>Bobbie will be <a href="http://blog.readmatter.com/post/34105823590/appearances">talking at several venues</a> in the near future about Matter to promote its upcoming launch, and the <a href="http://hackshackersbelfast.tumblr.com/">Belfast chapter of HacksHackers</a> will likely be returning in the near future to Farset for more events.</p>

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re launching our first crowd-funding drive to raise £2000 for 3D printing facilities in the space.</p>
<p>Since <em>before</em> day one, a 3D printer has been on the minds of the community (and plenty of people who have said that they would join the community if those facilities were available), and now, <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">we&#8217;re ready to rock</a>!<span id="more-698"></span></p>
<h1>&#8220;Hold on, what are you getting?&#8221;</h1>
<p>What we&#8217;re asking for is £2,000 for an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/ultimaker-kits.html">Ultimaker 3D Printer</a>, an <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html">UltiController</a> (allowing members to print their plans directly from SD card), and several kilos of <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">ABS and PLA Plastic</a> to actually print, along with a rolling tool-table to keep all of the relevant parts in one &#8216;package&#8217; for easy use.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://blog.ultimaker.com/about/">Dutch</a> designed and manufactured kits can deposit 3mm diameter ABS or PLA plastic to an accuracy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0125+mm">12.5 micrometres</a>, in a potential build volume of over <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=21x21x22+cm">2.5 gallons</a>, at a rate of a cubic centimetre every 7 seconds, at a rough cost of 4p/cm$^3$.</p>
<h1>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it just be bought outright?&#8221;</h1>
<p>Farset Labs serves a wide community with very disparate interests, from PS2 Clustering to Pinball repair. As such, it isn&#8217;t fair for the collective community to pay so much for one sector, especially if the interest in that sector is speculative. Beyond that argument, Farset Labs operates on a break-even basis at the minute and as such, simply can&#8217;t afford such a large investment at this time.</p>
<h1>&#8220;So what do I get for my hard earned donation?&#8221;</h1>
<p>There are nine donation reward levels, ranging from &#8216;Just feeling good about yourself&#8217; to a years Freelancer membership plus a choice between the intermediate reward levels. In between, the individual &#8216;swag&#8217; items on offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name on a Laser Etched Plaque on the machine</li>
<li>A 3D printed of the brand new Farset Labs logo</li>
<li>A 3D printed model of your choice, along with a timelapse video of your model being printed</li>
<li>Customised Farset Labs tee-shirt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> Kit and Personalised 3D printed Case</li>
<li>and Email and Video &#8220;Thank you&#8221; messages from the Directors</li>
</ul>
<h1>&#8220;But&#8230; But&#8230; But&#8230; I wanted 3D printing time?!&#8221;</h1>
<p>Ahh, but that&#8217;s the big story; 3D printing will be free for all membership levels and the consumable supplies will be taken out of the global community budget (once we run out of the specific 3D printer funds).</p>
<p>This freedom will be on a &#8216;fair use&#8217; basis; if you wish to do any larger scale manufacture, please <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">order</a> your own materials and feel free to use the printer here!</p>
<h1>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m sold, I&#8217;ll chuck a few quid in&#8221;</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw">Thank you!</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re running the <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume</a> until Sunday the 18th of November, and hope to get your tasty tasty rewards out to you before Christmas, so please share this blog post to anyone who you think would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please let us know below or on the campaign.</p>

<p><span id="more-687"></span>The format is the same as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of <strong>7 minutes</strong> to speak on the subject of their choice. This will be<strong> enforced with projectiles</strong> this time.</li>
<li>The Use of <strong>Non-Projected</strong> Visual Aids is heavily encouraged (but if you really need a power point, that&#8217;s ok too, <strong>it&#8217;s just not very cool</strong>)</li>
<li>On the night, presenters (planned or unplanned) are invited to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order in which presentations will be done, <strong>so be nice to him/her</strong></li>
<li>Punishment for rule/time violators is <strong>at the disgression of the sponsor</strong>, in this case the BCS</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garage <strong>Beer</strong> Brewing</li>
<li>The <strong>Media</strong> Community in Northern Ireland</li>
<li>BBC CPR &#8211; Micro <strong>Resuscitation</strong></li>

<li>Circuit <strong>Bending</strong> Killed The Video Star</li>
<li>AND <strong>MOAR</strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you wanted to fiddle with electronics but don&#8217;t have the equipment or knowledge?<img decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-682" title="Massimo Bazai" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5537363317_7ee0c04ac4-198x3001.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="180" /></p>
<p><span id="more-680"></span>Last were contacted by an Italian Maker-collective called <a title="WeFab.it" href="http://www.wefab.it/" target="_blank">WeFab.it</a>, who are associated with the fantastic <a href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> project for electronics experimentation and prototyping.</p>
<p>They were kindly letting us know about a new RS sponsored video series walking through RS&#8217;s new <a title="Arduino Starter Kit" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/7617355/?" target="_blank">Arduino Starter Kit</a> (£67), presented by Arduino co-founder <a href="http://www.massimobanzi.com/" target="_blank">Massimo Banzi</a> (yes, that is his real surname).</p>
<p>On Monday, they presented their first video, &#8220;Get to know your tools&#8221;. The video explains how to build a basic circuit with the Arduino board, and how to use each of the basic components such as LEDs, switches, and resistors. So if you are new to electronics, this is a must!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2X8d_r0p92U?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a programme of 10 videos lined up, finishing up with a Twitter Controlled Mood Lamp, which we here at Farset Labs will be really interested to see, considering our occasionally depressed Nabaztag&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been walking a few of the drop-ins through similar circuits, and these videos are going to be a great resource for education. And the Starter packs look pretty darned handy too&#8230;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Depending on the community response to these videos, we&#8217;re investigating getting a few of the educational packs for the space, so if you&#8217;d be interested in this, PLEASE let us know in the comments section!</p>
