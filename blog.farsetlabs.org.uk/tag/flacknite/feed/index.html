<h1>Blurb</h1>
<p>On Saturday the 15th of October, we are running a 12 hour hacknite event where anyone with an idea, or a half-attempted project can come and share their passion with their peers.</p>
<p>FlackNite (<em>F</em>arset <em>L</em>abs h<em>ack nite</em>) is the return to our old model of regular, open, tech-events. The challenge is simple; start, finish, or just extend a technical project or solve a problem in 12 hours. FlackNite offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event will be lightly catered thanks to support from the <a href="http://hackthehub.com/">HackTheHub</a> and the <a href="https://accelerite.com/products/aepona/">Aepona Accelerite</a> teams, and every attendee is welcome to use the rest of the resources available at Farset Labs if they are not already a member. People are welcome to come and go as they please throughout the 12-hour event, and are more than welcome to bring whatever and whoever they wish to help their ideas come to reality.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>And to kick things off, an apology; our provisionally scheduled Raspberry Jam on the 12th has been postponed until after the exam season as it&#8217;s been difficult to get people able to help out at the event. Raspberry Jam will return February</p>
<h1>GoL: Thur 17th Jan<a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189138854?ref=ebtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189138854&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - Gathering of Lightning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-958" alt="light-wide" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/light-wide-300x1511.jpg" width="300" height="151" /></a></h1>
<p>Currently proposed (but not scheduled) topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Update] Brendan Drain from Brain and Nerd, who had recent success with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nyphur/predestination-a-turn-based-space-4x-strategy-game">Predestination</a>, will be talking about how he got started in Games Development (and what to avoid!)</li>
<li>[Update] Niall Bole, Engineer, Gamer, Organiser, and Placement student at NACCO will be talking about &#8216;Using <a href="http://www.ashtoncentre.com/fablab">Fablabs</a> for Fun and Profit&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMathematicsandPhysics/Research/ResearchStudents/StudentInfo/?id=540">Colin Kelsey</a>, from QUB&#8217;s Centre for Plasma Physics, with what he describes as &#8220;either functional plasma physics or a big surprise&#8221;</li>
<li>Rebecca Lutton, a mechanical engineer of <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Bright-Club-Belfast-Bright-Club-Belfast-9-Women-on-Top">Bright Club </a>fame with &#8216;Observational Humerology &#8211; The curse of innuendo&#8217;</li>
<li>Andrew Bolster on getting your Raspberry Pi to talk to the real world using the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a></li>
<li>Dylan Wylie, another Physicist, who is ambiguously talking about &#8216;<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3shy07.jpg">Quantum Theory, Maybe</a>&#8216;</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all our lighting events, this is an open call, so even if you just want to say something on the night, we&#8217;ll have the blackboard grid up so can literally sign up to talk during the other talks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also hopefully be live streaming this one&#8230; maybe&#8230;<br />

<h1>Global Game Jam Flacknite: Fri 25th<a href="http://flacknite-ggj13.eventbrite.com/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-959" alt="ggjlogo1dates" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ggjlogo1dates-300x521.png" width="300" height="52" /></a></h1>
<p>This time around we&#8217;re collaborating with the <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">University of Ulster&#8217;s Office of Innovation</a> to run the 2013 Northern Ireland <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">Global Game Jam</a></p>
<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world&#8217;s largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games… while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don’t code can contribute to a game.</p>
<p>This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Donations are not required for this event</strong> as refreshment costs are covered by <a href="http://oi.ulster.ac.uk/">UUOI</a>, but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!<br />
<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5189530024?ref=ebtn" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" alt="Eventbrite - Flacknite - GlobalGameJam 2013" src="http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5189530024" /></a></p>
<h1>Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href="http://fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com" rel="attachment wp-att-960"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960" alt="logo" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo-150x1501.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></h1>
<p>After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!</p>
<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.</p>
<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi</strong> to come to a meeting. In fact, not having a Raspberry Pi is an excellent motive for coming along. You will discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi when you do manage to get hold of one.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stuff we&#8217;ll be trying out:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A &#8216;beginners guide&#8217; walk through of how to get started with your Pi</li>
<li>Getting started with Hardware interfaces to the Raspberry Pi (including the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>)</li>
<li>Some show-and-tell demonstrations of cool projects people have already done with their Pi&#8217;s</li>
<li>Breaking to a relaxed evening of Pi-Jamming, where everyone is encouraged to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div>Children are welcome to attend the event, when accompanied by a parent or guardian.</div>
<div>We will try to get our hands on as many HDMI compatible monitors as we can, <strong>but please try and BYO monitor.</strong> We have plenty of mice and keyboards, but few HDMI compatible monitors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, if anyone would like to present any projects or just help out with the organisation of this event (or give feedback based on the last events) get in touch with us via events@farsetlabs.org.uk (or any of the dozen or so other ways you&#8217;ll be able to get us on!)</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our members and followers, will be aware, Flacknite is our semi-regular monthly hackathon, spanning at least 24 hours, which is open to everyone. It provides a bed, a home and an excuse for projects that have been put back, and a lively environment for more time-sensitive ones. As always, they&#8217;re catered with food and drink, which this month was generously sponsored by <a title="Instil" href="http://instil.co/">Instil Software</a>.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s Flacknite ran on September 15th and 16th, and brought to life several different projects. Several internal software projects marched onwards towards completion, piecing together our in-house management system and building control network.</p>
<figure id="attachment_664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-664" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.131.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-664" title="2012-09-16 04.35.13" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.13-300x1791.jpg" alt="Culture Night Preparations" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-664" class="wp-caption-text">Electronics and LED-testing going on into the night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more exciting and eye-catching work took the form of some preparations for <a href="http://www.culturenightbelfast.com/">Culture Night</a>, which has been making news throughout Belfast and scheduled for tonight, Friday 21st September. Robin, an artist attending Culture Night, built and tested several high-power LED array bars, to be used in his project to under-illuminate a table. His work will be on show tonight near the Hayfield Market in Belfast City Centre.</p>
<p>A welcome break came in the form of <a href="http://operapizza.co.uk/">Opera Pizza</a>, which delivered a substantial order to our door for all to graze on. Beer and pizza flowed plentifully for several hours after the delivery.</p>
<figure id="attachment_666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-666" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.371.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-666 " title="2012-09-16 01.47.37" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.37-300x1791.jpg" alt="The BBC Micro lives!" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-666" class="wp-caption-text">The BBC Micro lives!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Work continued in other parts of the building, with Dan Reid and Tom Gilmour working with others to bring to life two BBC Micro computers, both of which had dead power supplies. They were successful and much of the remainder of the night was spent programming the Micros, and upgrading their RAM installations. Dan continued in the following days to install more RAM and software, and the two computers are approaching &#8220;perfect working order&#8221; condition.</p>
<p>Others worked on personal projects and private endeavours, and most stuck around until the daylight hours on Sunday. Numbers waned due to sleep, but recovered later on Sunday. Overall, numbers were good and the atmosphere was great. Our next Flacknite will be next month, on the 20th October, and will be publicised heavily to let everyone know.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.instil.co">Instil Software</a> for their generosity, and for everyone that came along to such a good night!</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>

Open Data is the big buzzword of our day. And with connected health and data visualisation being similar scale buzzwords, we thought it&#8217;d be good to have a series of nice relaxed &#8216;Open Data Playground&#8217; events, where web devs, graphic designers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">*QL</a> sorcerers, and Data mining enthusiasts can hang out and play with bits.</p>
<p>No pressure, no &#8216;sponsors&#8217;, no competitions. Just pure unadulterated geekery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flacknite was a great success, despite being stood up by Red Bull and some questionable sleeping patterns!</p>
<p>All in all, we got a lot done, and have learned a lot about how people work independently in these kind of events;</p>
<p>In terms of &#8216;stuff done&#8217;, probably the best show piece was <a title="Ryan Grieve" href="http://thegrieve.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Ryan Grieve</a>&#8216;s <a title="MicroID" href="http://ryangrieve.com/games/microid/" target="_blank">Microid game</a> that he wrote for  <strong><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild/" target="_blank">Mini LD</a></strong> games jam &#8211; 19th-20th May 2012, where he restricted himself to 64&#215;18 pixels, causing hours and hours of lost/distracted time for everyone else! Thanks Ryan!</p>
<p>Additionally, we got alot of work done in terms of our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-rfid-acc" target="_blank">RFID access system</a>, even though our planned external reader turned out to be a &#8216;useless&#8217; standard that no-one has&#8230; But our striker is working and we&#8217;re waiting on a new reader to open the space up to all. CCTV is up, but not ready yet, <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-cctv/activity" target="_blank">pending the arrival of our capture card</a>. Network is done to <a href="http://twitter.com/stealthii" target="_blank">Stealthii&#8217;s </a>satisfaction.</p>
<p>Andrew Luke got a lot of work done on his great <a title="Absence Comic" href="http://absencecomic.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for his comic about coping with Epilepsy, a project part funded by <a title="UnLtd" href="http://www.unltd.org.uk/" target="_blank">UnLtd</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/stevebiscuit" target="_blank">Steve Wilkin</a> got a <a href="http://sickbiscuit.com/blog/2012/05/20/an-ios-client-for-my-coffee-tracker-api/" target="_blank">iOS client for his CoffeeTracker</a> project built.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> and co were working on a Native iOS management app for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB </a>instances.</p>
<p>We all ate lots of <a title="Cupcakes" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N5S41ZnlKU/T7pveUCvZBI/AAAAAAAAA34/eDb6jMsu-QM/s912/IMG_20120519_134710.jpg" target="_blank">cupcakes</a>, and <a href="http://dominos.co.uk" target="_blank">Dominos</a> pizza, drank <a href="http://www.craftydevil.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crafty Devil</a> supplied Beer, and devoured <a href="http://planzai.com/" target="_blank">Planzai</a> supplied <a href="http://www.boojummex.com/" target="_blank">Boojum</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, Noah built <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203881118984978435/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>. Long may he build <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/d3z/status/203893358639325184/photo/1" target="_blank">trucks</a>! He&#8217;s inspired us to &#8216;acquiring&#8217; a box-o-lego&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for making it as awesome as it was. See you next time!</p>

<h1>Blurb</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" title="More..." src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />On Saturday the 19th of May, we are running a 24 hour overnight event where anyone with an idea, or a half-attempted project can come and share their passion with their peers.</p>
<p>FlackNite (<em>F</em>arset <em>L</em>abs h<em>ack</em>) is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events. The challenge is simple; finish a technical project or solve a problem in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work. FlackNite offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested. If you want to get involved, <em>register your interest</em> on our <a href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/flacknite" target="_blank">Digital Circle</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327741213966426/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> event, and don&#8217;t forget to <em>put any half-baked project ideas</em> onto the <a title="WIKI!!! TROLOLOLOLL" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/FlackNite" target="_blank">wiki</a> to find a team or just give someone else a good idea.</p>
<p>Also,<em> if you want to get started</em>, there is a section for Member Projects on the Farset Labs <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-members">Redmine</a> software.</p>
<p>The event will be lightly catered and every attendee is welcome to use the rest of the resources available at Farset Labs if they are not already a member. People are welcome to come and go as they please throughout the 24-hour event, and are more than welcome to bring whatever and whoever they wish to help their ideas come to reality.</p>
