										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our members and followers, will be aware, Flacknite is our semi-regular monthly hackathon, spanning at least 24 hours, which is open to everyone. It provides a bed, a home and an excuse for projects that have been put back, and a lively environment for more time-sensitive ones. As always, they&#8217;re catered with food and drink, which this month was generously sponsored by <a title="Instil" href="http://instil.co/">Instil Software</a>.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s Flacknite ran on September 15th and 16th, and brought to life several different projects. Several internal software projects marched onwards towards completion, piecing together our in-house management system and building control network.</p>
<figure id="attachment_664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-664" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.131.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-664" title="2012-09-16 04.35.13" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-04.35.13-300x1791.jpg" alt="Culture Night Preparations" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-664" class="wp-caption-text">Electronics and LED-testing going on into the night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more exciting and eye-catching work took the form of some preparations for <a href="http://www.culturenightbelfast.com/">Culture Night</a>, which has been making news throughout Belfast and scheduled for tonight, Friday 21st September. Robin, an artist attending Culture Night, built and tested several high-power LED array bars, to be used in his project to under-illuminate a table. His work will be on show tonight near the Hayfield Market in Belfast City Centre.</p>
<p>A welcome break came in the form of <a href="http://operapizza.co.uk/">Opera Pizza</a>, which delivered a substantial order to our door for all to graze on. Beer and pizza flowed plentifully for several hours after the delivery.</p>
<figure id="attachment_666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-666" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.371.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-666 " title="2012-09-16 01.47.37" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-16-01.47.37-300x1791.jpg" alt="The BBC Micro lives!" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-666" class="wp-caption-text">The BBC Micro lives!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Work continued in other parts of the building, with Dan Reid and Tom Gilmour working with others to bring to life two BBC Micro computers, both of which had dead power supplies. They were successful and much of the remainder of the night was spent programming the Micros, and upgrading their RAM installations. Dan continued in the following days to install more RAM and software, and the two computers are approaching &#8220;perfect working order&#8221; condition.</p>
<p>Others worked on personal projects and private endeavours, and most stuck around until the daylight hours on Sunday. Numbers waned due to sleep, but recovered later on Sunday. Overall, numbers were good and the atmosphere was great. Our next Flacknite will be next month, on the 20th October, and will be publicised heavily to let everyone know.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.instil.co">Instil Software</a> for their generosity, and for everyone that came along to such a good night!</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>

Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; Farset Labs has several ages&#8230;<span id="more-396"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>3 weeks since our first big event (<a title="SpringUp: Launching Five Startups in 28 Hours" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/springup-launching-five-startups-in-28-hours/">SpringUp</a>)</li>
<li>3 weeks and 1 day since we got heating</li>
<li>1 month in the building (officially)</li>
<li>36 days in the building from first &#8216;preparation&#8217;</li>
<li>2 months since first discussions with Weavers Court</li>
<li>3 months since registration with companies house / HMRC</li>
<li>6 months since the property hunt went into full swing (cheers to Eoghan, David, and Conor; a cracking property-survey team)</li>
<li>7 months of operating with the name &#8216;Farset Labs&#8217;</li>
<li>10 months of running hackathon events with <a href="http://quests.qub.ac.uk">QUESTS</a> and QUB <a href="http://www.dragonslayers.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dragonslayers</a></li>
<li>12 months since founding QUESTS</li>
<li>19 months of regular &#8216;Pub&#8217; meetings with the local tech community, spawning off some great projects and ideas along the way.</li>
<li>21 months since I came back from America full of energy and optimism</li>
<li>21 months and 19 days since I wrote the first entry on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/belfast-hackspace-working-group/KJw3A8uAdXA" target="_blank">Belfast Hackerspace Working Group</a>, lying in a hammock at the Pennsylvania Hotel, NY, at <a href="http://thenexthope.org/" target="_blank">TheNextHope</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#8217;ve done brilliantly. I want to personally thank everyone who has been involved in this effort over all this time and hope that we&#8217;ll continue to make this even more awesome than it already is.</p>
<p>Coming up is what looks to become our flagship regular event; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357/" target="_blank">FlackNite</a>; an intensive &#8216;lock-in&#8217; (no, we won&#8217;t lock you in) where members, old and new, can come and work on their projects and showcase them to their peers. We&#8217;re working to get some &#8216;VIP&#8217;s over, but mum&#8217;s the word on that for the time being. Since we&#8217;re making this up as we go along, we welcome any and all advice/ideas/insults as to how we&#8217;re doing things.</p>
<p>Work progresses on the CCTV and Access Control (RFID) system, and the User Management System (tasty tasty karma) is under-way. Hopefully the directors will be able to stop working at some point and start doing our own projects, but not yet! We&#8217;re doing this for you!</p>
<p>So, tell your friends, tell your family, tell your boss, tell your colleagues, tell your lecturer, tell your classmates,</p>
<p>Farset Labs is here to stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The launch day went, in our humble opinions, fantastically.</p>
<p>As in, really fantastic.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve met our targets and everything passed smoothly, but, far more importantly, we had an awful lot of fun.  A range of projects were attempted by those in the space over the 24-hr period, some of which were unexpected, all of which were cool. We can only mention a selection of the activities, but some of the most notable follow.</p>
<p>Andrew Sheppard learnt the ropes on an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> and got some guidance on some of the low-level aspects of microcontroller interfacing. He also went nuts with a labeller in the kitchen. Ben Bland and Conor Flanagan, among other things, did the necessary measurements and are well on the way to creating a <a href="http://www.blender.org/">3D model</a> of the building. Eoghan Murray and Conor Robinson set up an <a href="http://www.rsgb.org/">amateur radio station</a> in the Event Space, with an antenna running nearly the length of the building. It was <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/contents">illegal</a> for around two minutes when one non-licensed member decided to try and chat to someone. Sighs were heard all round. Then David Kane joined them and they went numbers station hunting, successfully tuning into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVB-76">UVB-76</a> from Russia on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2EKWgTNEYU">4625kHz</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the lounge, Niall Bole masterminded a gaming system with an Xbox 360 and projector that kept everyone entertained when they weren&#8217;t working. Likewise, the library and the vintage hardware were used both for amusement and for serious reference, with copies of <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/">Wired</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yourself-Electricity-Electronics-Fourth-Edition/dp/0071459332">Teach Yourself Electricity and Electronics</a> (Gibilisco), to name a couple, taken off the shelves and used. The ancient CRO was connected to&#8230;er&#8230;<em>something</em> that Conor Robinson built in the Event Space, with William Cully looking on, vaguely confused at the erratic waveform. The <a href="http://www.toshiba-europe.com/bv/computers/products/notebooks/portege620ct/index.shtm">Portege</a> laptop also disappeared with Chris Murray and was booted and explored.</p>
<p>The kitchen proved to be a good social hub, with people taking a break around coffee or a beer, leaving the gamers and their spectators at peace in the lounge, though cheers and lamentations could be heard constantly through the open door. We thought heating may be a problem (and had electric heaters at the ready), due to our lack of gas for the boiler at the minute, but attendance was so good that body heat (plus the heat from our servers) warmed the building comfortably.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was brilliant, with a party mood blended perfectly with a work ethos and several people mucked in to get the network infrastructure upgraded and humming along even faster than before. All of this was fuelled off snacks, soft drinks and some harder ones provided by Farset Labs, as well as a pizza order organised by the Prince of Pizza, Niall Bole. Rachel Gregg provided the most awesome cupcakes ever tasted by exhausted hackers, giving a taste of what the Bakerspace will be like.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t mention everyone of the 30+ people who came to the space and their projects, mainly because I (David) didn&#8217;t even get the time to go around them all, despite wanting to, but there was a wide variety of awesomeness being attempted.</p>
<p>The 24-hr event thinned out on the Saturday morning, but, after people got a few hours sleep, several members (and the directors) came back and worked in the space together, with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7F37BB1A67E0238D&amp;feature=plcp">Tron soundtrack</a> providing the backing music. It was great to see people eager to come back right away and everyone worked until around 10pm on the Saturday night. The space (at this time on a Sunday night) has six people currently in it&#8230;and we&#8217;re about to take a break and educate three of them in the wondrous series that is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Firefly</a></em>.</p>
<p>And so closes Farset Lab&#8217;s first weekend. We&#8217;re all wrecked, full of junk food and haven&#8217;t been seen by significant others in too long, but, damn, it was good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-186" title="The Store" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-02-18.21.47-300x1791.jpg" alt="Equipment in the store" width="300" height="179" />Another day of frantic work and continuous driving has brought us much closer to our launch tomorrow. The plumbers have completely fitted the toilets to a great standard and the electricians are making sense of the circuits around the building; the puzzle pieces that were outside our control have pretty much fallen into place. After a long day driving to collect tables, hoovering endless dust and generally cleaning up, we&#8217;re about to pack up for the night, exhausted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve fitted out the reception area with a little more server equipment and a slightly fancier network configuration, and have the water supply turned on, making the space a lot more pleasant to be in. The contractors are finishing up and our outer window frames received a welcome coat of paint. Windows were scraped and the equipment store was further populated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, final preparations include the plumbers and electricians finishing up, the hopeful delivery of our electric cooker, preparations for the rooms and general last-minute cleaning.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see you all at our <a title="Launch Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191615090954138/">launch event</a> tomorrow at 3pm!</p>
