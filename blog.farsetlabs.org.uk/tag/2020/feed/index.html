<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Global Game Jam is back in the building to kick-off the new year!</strong><br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">Register your seat now!</a></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>&nbsp;at Farset Labs is back again in 2020, with support from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/" target="_blank">Northern Ireland Screen</a>. The Game Jam will run <strong>from Friday 31st January to Sunday 2nd February</strong> &#8211; come meet some great people and develop a game idea in a weekend. With a party atmosphere from Friday night, there will be plenty of people there to team up with, create something interesting and (most importantly) to have fun!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS GLOBAL GAME JAM?</strong></p>



<p>A global simultaneous&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hackathon&nbsp;</a>making games of all sorts, from full-scale console productions to mobile, web-based and embedded games, as well as table-top board- and card-games. Some will be just for fun, others for charitable causes like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games For Change</a>, and none of them exist before this weekend!</p>



<p><strong>Farset Labs</strong> has been running Northern Ireland’s largest regular public GGJ site since&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-to-host-global-game-jam-for-new-world-record-breaking-event/" target="_blank">2013</a>, this year joining over 100 other countries taking part. We will be live streaming video from sites all over the world during the weekend, and there will also be an opportunity to see and play other teams’ games at the end of the event. The details of the venue are also available on our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam listing</a>.</p>



<p><strong>HOW DO I ENTER?</strong></p>



<p>We ask that you <strong>reserve your seat</strong> at Farset Labs <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-game-jam-belfast-2020-registration-85428511979">on Eventbrite</a>, so that we can get accurate numbers for our food orders (included in your registration).</p>



<p>You can then complete your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/farset-labs" target="_blank">Global Game Jam registration</a>&nbsp;on or <strong>before Friday 31st January</strong>.</p>



<p>Global Game Jam is always very popular; so to avoid disappointment, book early!</p>



<p>Registration this year is <strong>£5.99 per person</strong> &#8211; registration will reserve your seat for the weekend as well as helping us to provide you with catered meals for the full weekend and unique GGJ Belfast goodies!</p>



<p>The theme is announced on-site at <strong>5pm on Friday 31st January</strong> so we recommend everyone be in Farset before that time, or send word if you will be arriving later on. We look forward to seeing you all, as it will be a great weekend!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>



<p>There is no required skill level or barrier for entry; we welcome programmers, artists, musicians and anyone else who might be interested in being involved! Bring yourself and your equipment – the organisers recommend that participants wait until the beginning of the event to form teams. We have found that this worked well in the past and gives interesting results.</p>



<p><em>Please note:</em>&nbsp;<strong>You must be over 18</strong> on the 31st of January to participate.</p>



<p>More information will be provided in the run-up, but please feel free to contact&nbsp;<a href="http://mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>&nbsp;or ask us questions via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter&nbsp;</a>with the&nbsp;<strong>#farsetggj20</strong>&nbsp;hashtag.</p>
