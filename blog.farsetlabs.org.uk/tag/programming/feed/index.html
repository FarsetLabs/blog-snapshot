<p><strong><em>Farset Dojo is changing; we&#8217;re skipping December and moving from Eventbrite to Zen; restarting on the 8th of February, running every fortnight.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hello followers and supporters of Farset Dojo and awesome Guardians of the Ninjas.</p>



<p>We had planned to run our next event on Friday the 7th of December but have decided to postpone the Dojos until after the New Year! This is to allow the champions and mentors (and the ninjas!) to enjoy the holiday season with their families and friends. We&#8217;re also moving from EventBrite to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/home">Zen</a> (the global Coder Dojo website).</p>



<p>Zen has fantastic <a href="https://coderdojo.com/resources/">resources</a> available to ninjas and mentors, and it gives us a nice change when it comes to registering who will be attending.</p>



<p>Sign up to the new and shiny Farset Dojo <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo-belfast">here</a> if you want to attend any future events. We&#8217;ll be back to running <strong>every fortnight</strong> from Friday the 8th of February at 7pm!<br /></p>



<p>If you want to mentor you just need to <a href="https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo">register</a> at Farset Dojo or email <a href="mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk">dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk</a>.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re super excited to get back into it in February, and we look forward to starting an awesome year with the ninjas.</p>



<p>______________</p>



<p>Happy Holidays, from Zoe &amp; Andrew</p>



<p>xxxx<br /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any visionary, dreamer or hapless idiot trying to drive societal change, there can be few things more vindicating than the sight of school-age kids teaching adults how to do things. I wandered into our <a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> event on Saturday and felt the status bar on my Hope Drive stretch out a little, maybe from orange into green. Raspberry Jams are open to anyone and this time we had people from zero years-old (yes, actually) up to, well, I wouldn&#8217;t like to say but put it this way: they&#8217;d remember Belfast before The Troubles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0jR88ed-4_k" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This time the regular Farset crowd got a big boost by having the running of the event taken off our hands by the irrepressible <a href="http://pi.gbaman.info/" target="_blank">AndrewMulholland</a>, who finds time amidst schoolwork to <a href="https://github.com/gbaman" target="_blank">make and teach</a> technology (we hear his latest projectÂ  with his <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=161" target="_blank">school robotics club</a> is a cardboard quadcopter; turns out the sky isn&#8217;t the limit!). Andrew is one of a line of <a href="http://www.dalriadaschool.com/">Dalriada</a> acolytes to find their way to Farset somehow, setting a high bar for the involvement of NI&#8217;s schools in the maker revolution.</p>
<p><span id="more-1421"></span></p>
<p>Going round the room, seated in front of monitors and amongst a snakes&#8217; nest of cables, circuit boards, network components and blinking lights, there was a complete range of capabilities in the room. Parents were teaching kids, and kids were teaching parents. One of the frequent young visitors to the space, an unflinchingly energetic fourteen year-old, handed me his smartphone and said &#8220;press one of these coloured buttons&#8221;. I hit green. The mobile spoke to his web server in Holland and that in turn signalled the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in front of him to illuminate the green LED wired into it. Frivolous? Maybe. But it&#8217;s from that kind of tinkering that world-changing technologies emerge.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees had come to learn the basics of programming and interfaces, by using the Pi to run <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the supersimplestraightforward program from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> that teaches basic coding. But these Jams, as with most of our hacking events, are there for all levels of skill and knowledge. There was John, for instance, who showed me his work on <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com/">The vOICe</a>. This is a camera system that is worn on a pair of glasses by a blind person, to scan the world in front of them and interpret it into an audio signal. They call it &#8220;seeing with sound&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of those ideas that makes you optimistic for the human world. John is trying to simplify the system and reduce its weight by running it on a Raspberry Pi rather than a heavy laptop. Anyone able to offer some help for John, get in touch.</p>
<p>So what next for Raspberry Pi? Well we&#8217;re looking to upgrade our collection and have dedicated sets with all the necessary peripherals for anyone to use as starter kits. Any help we can get with that would offer a huge return on investment for the community. And it&#8217;s just three months to the global <a>Raspberry Jamboree</a> too.</p>
<p>All together now, sing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7v2KafFuH8">Raaaaasp-berry Boree&#8230;</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>No? Just me? Getting old? Ye gads.</p>

<p>Farset Labs is planning on running an event to introduce any person of any age to embedded programming; spanning from building your own controller board that you can take home, right up to programming it with some basic functionality. But we want to get the community&#8217;s opinion before we set anything in stone.</p>
<p>Please, take a minute of your time to fill outÂ <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ" target="_blank">this survey</a>Â so we can make the best event for you.<span id="more-325"></span></p>
<p>In other news,</p>
<ul>
<li>We broke through 100 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/farsetlabs" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Likes last week, and no one noticed;</li>
<li><a href="http://springup.co" target="_blank">SpringUp</a>Â was a fantastic success, and we welcome the winning/runner-up teams, Al.rg and betExpertise to their free memberships;</li>
<li>Our open/closed status is now listed on the <a href="http://hackerspaces.me/wall" target="_blank">Global Hackerspace Wall</a> and our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Front Page</a> (which got a little redesign last week);</li>
<li>Our trip to the <a href="http://syncni.com/news/p.php?id=6182" target="_blank">ITE Titans</a> event at <a href="http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">The Titanic Belfast</a> was a very interesting evening for all involved;</li>
<li>Confirmed our Charitable Status (XT33366 if anyone cares) and we secured our Rates-exempt status (making the financial future a little less foggy);</li>
<li>Rolled out our temporary online membership / donation system (donation button is over that &gt; way &gt; *hint*);</li>
<li>Set up a <a title="Wiki" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank">Wiki</a> to manage the internals of the space (work very much in progress);</li>
<li>Set up a <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine</a> Project Management system (again, work in progress).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all in all, it&#8217;s starting to come together.</p>
<p>In ten days we&#8217;ll close out our &#8216;Founding Member&#8217; list &#8211; on the 6th of May, Farset Labs is a month old. Every member who signed up in that time will have their name (or username, if desired [and SFW]) laser etched into a metal plate that will hang in the Labs for as long as they survive.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve been on the fence about joining, now&#8217;s the time to <a title="Membership" href="http://www.blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">sign up</a>. And remember, pop in any time* to check the place out.</p>
<p>*No, we are not 24/7 yet, just watch the <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/status.html" target="_blank">Status</a> page.</p>
