										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our long and exciting <a href="http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer">Sponsume campaign</a> is finally over, and there is evidently plenty of support for a 3D printer within the space &#8211; we raised over £100 extra by the time the fundraiser was finished. In the time that it ran, we saw very evident spikes and patterns, which coincided nicely with various announcements and media publishers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg1.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-853" title="oimg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/oimg-300x1851.png" alt="Breakdown of rewards" width="300" height="185" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-853" class="wp-caption-text">Breakdown of donators by which reward they chose</figcaption></figure>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who helped get the word out about the campaign, and would especially like to thank every single person who backed the Sponsume appeal. Even now we are getting occasional offers from people who want to chip in a little more towards consumables. We hope that everyone that donated enjoys their rewards, which will be sent out in the following weeks after they are all organised and produced.</p>
<p>Once the custom print rewards are finished, the 3D printer will be open for every member of Farset Labs to access whenever they wish. Significant quantities of PLA and ABS plastic have been ordered, and this is open for all members to use in small-scale production. Anyone wishing to make lots of models or make very big items is requested to play fair and <a href="https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/consumables.html">buy their own plastic</a>, or donate towards getting more for the space. Apart from that, there are absolutely no restrictions on use, and we look forward to seeing what people make with the machine.</p>
<p>The Ultimaker is <strong>now in the post</strong>, and is expected within around a week. Announcements will be made when it arrives, and everyone involved in the fundraiser and purchase will be invited down to build and be the first to use it.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone that helped. Thanks to you, we now have a fantastic tool to make Farset Labs a much more useful and interesting place.</p>

<h1>Project Management: 3D Printer</h1>
<p>If you want to get more involved in how the day to day operation of Farset Labs goes, including our upcoming fundraising for our 3D printer, swing over to our <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/" target="_blank">Redmine </a>to start making your mark, even if it is just reporting &#8216;bugs&#8217; with our current system.</p>
<h1><a title="FlackNite" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357">FlackNite</a>: 1400 19/05/2012</h1>
<h2>Internal Event: Members (Free), Day pass (£5)</h2>
<p>Flack (Farset Labs hACK) night is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events.</p>
<p>The challenge is simple; finish a technical project in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work.</p>
<p>Flack offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers. Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re up for it, start submitting your project ideas (or look for others to join up with) on our <a title="Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/a/ideafactory.do?id=17839&amp;mode=top&amp;discussionFilter=byids&amp;discussionID=28776" target="_blank">Ideascale</a>. If any specialist equipment or components are needed, also add them to the same &#8216;Flacknite the first&#8217; campaign.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re also looking for any talented Graphic Designers to put together a fancy pants logo for FlackNite. Please post any ideas or submissions publically on either the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs" target="_blank">facebook page</a>, or our twitter @FarsetLabs</strong></p>
<h1>Bloc54: 1700 22/05/2012</h1>
<h2>External Event: Free</h2>
<p>The Bloc54 Games network are coming back to FL for their <a title="Digital Circle" href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/bloc54-games-network-may-meetup" target="_blank">May meeting</a>, welcome back guys. They will celebrating the release of couple more games and hopefully hearing more about games development support from InvestNI, but are welcoming visitors/walkins as well.</p>
<p>They will have 3 projectors up and running so be demo-ready!</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Demos including Zombiesaurus Games</li>
<li>Unity 3D demo</li>
<li>More in event comments</li>
</ul>
<h1>Embedded Workshop: TBC</h1>
<p>The Results (hopefully live)</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="800" src="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewanalytics?formkey=dDhWWGdhdG1VRDRxNVZvQ0czUHJSWVE6MQ&amp;pli=1" width="320" height="240"></iframe></p>
<p>Make of that what you will.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be collating the results and making a decision as to the makeup and costing of the programme as soon as we get some free time (remember, volunteers with &#8216;day jobs&#8217;!)</p>
<p>If this is the first you&#8217;ve heard of this, refer back to our <a title="Planned Event: Embedded Programming; Fun with Boards" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/planned-event-embedded-programming-fun-with-boards/" target="_blank">previous post</a>!</p>
