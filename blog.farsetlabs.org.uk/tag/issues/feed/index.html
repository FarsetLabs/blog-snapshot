<p>TL;DR If there&#8217;s something that you think needs fixed/changed in Farset Labs, go to our somebody-should <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">Github Repo</a> and raise an issue.</p>



<p>Over the past 7 years, we&#8217;ve had Trello, Google Tasks, Asana, Trello Again, JIRA, Trello again and finally JIRA, as issue-management and tracking systems. All have had loads of bells and whistles and integrations and tracking workflows, and hardly any got used by the general membership to raise issues that were affecting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was living in Liverpool, I joined <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">DoESLivepool</a>. They have a very simple system that feeds in to not only their weeknotes bot, but also their machine booking and repair tracking system; a github repo that only stores issues, called <a href="https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should">somebody-should.</a></p>



<p>So, for the past month, we&#8217;ve been quietly switched over, referring people who raise issues in the Slack to raise an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">repo</a>, populating and processing a few sample issues, experimenting with milestones, and generally faffing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we&#8217;re &#8220;officially&#8221; announcing it. We&#8217;re still fiddling with some of the documentation, but as they say, no good plan survives contact with reality, so go raise some hell(ish issues).&nbsp;</p>
