										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to the #COVID19 pandemic, Farset Labs has made the following decisions.</p>



<ol><li>We are <strong>no longer hosting any public events</strong> as part of Farset Labs programmes (CoderDojo, ELi5, DataArt, etc)</li><li>All Meetings (Town Hall, Management, Trustees) will be <strong>remote</strong>.</li><li>It is recommended that external/community hires of the space also suspend, but events will over all be restricted to <strong>less than 15</strong> participants.</li><li>It is recommended that <strong>no more than 15 people</strong> are in the building at any one time</li><li>The facility will <strong>continue to be open</strong> to those who wish to use it, following reasonable precautions outlined below.</li><li>Private Meetings can still take place on site if <strong>reasonable precautions</strong> are enforced.</li><li><strong>Do not visit if you are symptomatic</strong> (continuous cough or high temperature).</li><li>If you develop symptoms and have visited the space in the previous 10 days, <strong>please notify us</strong> on <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></li><li><strong>Hand Sanitiser and Soap</strong> will become available throughout the building. </li><li>Facilities are being made available for event organisers to <strong>stream presentations </strong>to support sustaining their own communities online free of charge.</li></ol>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Provision of Streaming Facilities for Event Operators</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last week, we set up a<a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/event-space-streaming-av-setup/26"> two-camera streaming capability</a> in the event space. This capability is being made available to all event organisers; members or otherwise, for the purposes of hosting online events with presenters. We’re currently awaiting delivery of an HDMI capture device to include higher resolution of projected screen contents, but if you’d like to take advantage of this facility, please get in touch on <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Reasonable Precautions&nbsp;</h1>



<p>(As per <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS </a>and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">WHO</a> Advice)</p>



<ul><li>Wash hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds with hot water and soap.</li><li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.</li><li>Stay at home if you’ve got coronavirus symptoms.<ul><li>New, continuous cough.</li><li>High temperature above 37.5 degrees celsius.</li></ul></li><li>Advise social distancing for visitors and members.</li></ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Closing comments</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">There’s a lot of these statements going around, and it is a time of lots of news and statistics and a mix between panic and complacency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very high likelihood that we’ll have to shut the facility down completely in the coming weeks. Fortunately, we’re kinda used to that over the past year! If that’s the case we’ll be communicating both openly and privately with members to facilitate safely removing anything they might need from the space while instituting a full “lockdown”.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">In times like this, the physical building of Farset Labs is less important than the community; <strong>social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation</strong>. Whether you’re a member or not, stay connected on our <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Slack</a>, Share stuff that you think is cool on our <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Discourse</a>, and when open meetings come up, please dial in just to chill out.</p>



<p>Stay nerdy my friends.<br />the Farset Labs team</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>
