										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some say that he was once in a joint <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA" target="_blank">AMA</a> with <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/" target="_blank">Chuck Norris,</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIZU8cQWXc" target="_blank">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bc0WjTT0Ps" target="_blank">The Most Interesting Man In The World</a>, and still got the most questions.</p>
<p>All we know is, he&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Gilchrist_LLP" target="_blank">Martin Gilchrist</a>.</p>
<p>Martin is a regular user of the space and always has some hairbrained idea to try out and bash against the wall to see what sticks, and one day, he came to us with an idea for an informal networking event based around our georgous <a title="Paint It Black: This Weeks Updates" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/paint-it-black-this-weeks-updates/">blackboard</a>, which after some discussion developed into what we&#8217;re calling &#8216;Blackboard Tuesdays&#8217;</p>
<p>The Concept is simple. Intro Per Square Foot.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-617" title="blackboard" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/blackboard1.png" alt="" width="384" height="240" /><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>We have approx 30 square meters of blackboard. About 322 sqft in old money. We guestimate that about 250 of that is usable by the average human. We also have a <a href="http://youtu.be/HQDVYJGSHQI?hd=1" target="_blank">high definition camera</a> mounted in the ceiling that captures most of that blackboard.</p>
<p>Each attendee has a little over a square foot to describe themselves, make an impact, and leave enough contact details to be got in touch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the gimmick. The real draw is the community. As we&#8217;ve grown, Farset Labs has developed an amazing community of technologists and business leaders (often in the same body). We want to provide the ultimate relaxed &#8216;networking&#8217; environment where no one person can bogart the floor with their confidence, or the quiet one gets ignored.Everyone has a square foot*. Going over the lines will be punished by having your square wiped out and given to someone else. Inter-square war will be treated similarly, unless its really funny, in which case, we&#8217;ll allow it.</p>
<div class="inpostbox">
<h3>Vital Info</h3>
<p><strong>When: </strong><em>1600-1800 </em>Tuesday 04/09/12<br />
<strong>Event Links:</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/266733133426586/">Facebook Event</a></li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Our operational plan is to have an invited compere for each (hopefully monthly) session who will be the judge, jury and executioner for such infractions, and since it was mostly his idea, we&#8217;ve asked Martin to do the honours for our inaugural event.</p>
<p>Conveniently enough, our timing on this event corresponds with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/266733133426586/">Martin and Michelle&#8217;s fifth anniversary as Gilchrist &amp; Co</a>, so we&#8217;re letting him run rampant with branding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.20.4111.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-540" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px 6px;" title="2012-06-12 13.20.41" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.20.411-300x2251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>After two months of, although quirky, irrefutably &#8220;office&#8221; decor, it&#8217;s time for our event space to be restored to the Victorian charm from which it arose! For a while, we&#8217;ve been playing with the idea of getting rid of the suspended fibre ceiling in the space and exposing the period pillars and beams, and after a day&#8217;s experimentation, it&#8217;s decided: we&#8217;re going ahead!</p>
<p>What the vision entails is exposing the entirety of the building&#8217;s original woodwork and support pillars, and restoring them to their former glory. New architectural lighting, black ceiling beams and renovated cable management are all in the master plan, as well as some lovely aesthetic improvements like stripping the cast iron pillars to the bare metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-538" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px 6px;" title="2012-06-12 13.28.03" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-13.28.03-150x1501.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>However, we&#8217;ll need some assistance.</strong></p>
<p>We currently do not have many sets of <strong>ladders</strong> which are a crucial part of the project. Limited timescale and funds mean that the ceiling needs to be finished very promptly, so all help possible is appreciated.</p>
<p>We would greatly appreciate anyone who would be willing to help out or<strong> lend us some stepladders</strong> for the duration of the project; without your help it will be much harder to restore the Old Schoolhouse to its former glory!</p>
<p>If you would like to <strong>help out in any way</strong>, or would be willing to lend us some equipment, materials, or their time, please get in contact through the usual channels.</p>

<h1>Blurb</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" title="More..." src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />On Saturday the 19th of May, we are running a 24 hour overnight event where anyone with an idea, or a half-attempted project can come and share their passion with their peers.</p>
<p>FlackNite (<em>F</em>arset <em>L</em>abs h<em>ack</em>) is the first of a regular programme of 24-hour tech-events. The challenge is simple; finish a technical project or solve a problem in 24 hours, and be able to stand up in front of your peers and show off your work. FlackNite offers a platform for the rapid development of projects, as well as a structured and constructive feedback from peers.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, there will be regular breaks to talk through progress on projects, offering participants the opportunity to receive regular feedback on their progress, and the ability to change direction early, or add features suggested by peers, if needed.</p>
<p>Projects can be individual or team based, and the ‘show and tell’ part is optional but suggested. If you want to get involved, <em>register your interest</em> on our <a href="http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/flacknite" target="_blank">Digital Circle</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327741213966426/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> event, and don&#8217;t forget to <em>put any half-baked project ideas</em> onto the <a title="WIKI!!! TROLOLOLOLL" href="http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/index.php/FlackNite" target="_blank">wiki</a> to find a team or just give someone else a good idea.</p>
<p>Also,<em> if you want to get started</em>, there is a section for Member Projects on the Farset Labs <a href="http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/redmine/projects/farset-members">Redmine</a> software.</p>
<p>The event will be lightly catered and every attendee is welcome to use the rest of the resources available at Farset Labs if they are not already a member. People are welcome to come and go as they please throughout the 24-hour event, and are more than welcome to bring whatever and whoever they wish to help their ideas come to reality.</p>
