										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to the #COVID19 pandemic, Farset Labs has made the following decisions.</p>



<ol><li>We are <strong>no longer hosting any public events</strong> as part of Farset Labs programmes (CoderDojo, ELi5, DataArt, etc)</li><li>All Meetings (Town Hall, Management, Trustees) will be <strong>remote</strong>.</li><li>It is recommended that external/community hires of the space also suspend, but events will over all be restricted to <strong>less than 15</strong> participants.</li><li>It is recommended that <strong>no more than 15 people</strong> are in the building at any one time</li><li>The facility will <strong>continue to be open</strong> to those who wish to use it, following reasonable precautions outlined below.</li><li>Private Meetings can still take place on site if <strong>reasonable precautions</strong> are enforced.</li><li><strong>Do not visit if you are symptomatic</strong> (continuous cough or high temperature).</li><li>If you develop symptoms and have visited the space in the previous 10 days, <strong>please notify us</strong> on <a href="mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk">admin@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></li><li><strong>Hand Sanitiser and Soap</strong> will become available throughout the building. </li><li>Facilities are being made available for event organisers to <strong>stream presentations </strong>to support sustaining their own communities online free of charge.</li></ol>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Provision of Streaming Facilities for Event Operators</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last week, we set up a<a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/event-space-streaming-av-setup/26"> two-camera streaming capability</a> in the event space. This capability is being made available to all event organisers; members or otherwise, for the purposes of hosting online events with presenters. We’re currently awaiting delivery of an HDMI capture device to include higher resolution of projected screen contents, but if you’d like to take advantage of this facility, please get in touch on <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Reasonable Precautions&nbsp;</h1>



<p>(As per <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS </a>and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">WHO</a> Advice)</p>



<ul><li>Wash hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds with hot water and soap.</li><li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.</li><li>Stay at home if you’ve got coronavirus symptoms.<ul><li>New, continuous cough.</li><li>High temperature above 37.5 degrees celsius.</li></ul></li><li>Advise social distancing for visitors and members.</li></ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Closing comments</h1>



<p class="has-drop-cap">There’s a lot of these statements going around, and it is a time of lots of news and statistics and a mix between panic and complacency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very high likelihood that we’ll have to shut the facility down completely in the coming weeks. Fortunately, we’re kinda used to that over the past year! If that’s the case we’ll be communicating both openly and privately with members to facilitate safely removing anything they might need from the space while instituting a full “lockdown”.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">In times like this, the physical building of Farset Labs is less important than the community; <strong>social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation</strong>. Whether you’re a member or not, stay connected on our <a href="http://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Slack</a>, Share stuff that you think is cool on our <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Discourse</a>, and when open meetings come up, please dial in just to chill out.</p>



<p>Stay nerdy my friends.<br />the Farset Labs team</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we sent out survey requests to anyone who&#8217;d attended (and registered) to our <a href="https://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/">CoderDojo</a> programme since day one.</p>
<p>This was so we could get a better handle on what we were doing well, and maybe not so well, and was also intended to answer one simple question; which day is better to run it. I&#8217;ll not be making any grand analysis yet as I believe the results tell their own story.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to add your thoughts, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q6J2WGZ">the poll is still open</a>, but we&#8217;ll be feeding these findings back into our plan going forward and will let you know any changes ASAP.</p>
<p><a href="https://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.co.uk/">And don&#8217;t forget, the next dojo is next Friday</a></p>
<h1>What day of the week works best for you and your family to attend the Dojo in the evening</h1>
<p>We intentionally restricted the options in this question to Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday as Wednesday is already reserved for free for any usergroup that wants to hold an event, and Saturdays are too high value for hackathons and other events to block book.</p>

<li>The very young age group.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What did you dislike about the Dojos?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency of delivery.</li>
<li>Disappointing range of mentors, lack of organisation</li>

<li>We need a structured programme with lessons i.e. syllabus etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Would you like to say anything else about the Dojos? Good bad or ugly we want your feedback! Have the Dojo&#8217;s &#8220;changed&#8221;, if you went before, what stops you now? Anything, everything, we need your advice!</h1>

<li>I think this is a great opportunity for young people to learn the language and skills associated with computer programming that can only help them in the future, although i fear some children under 14 will not be able to avil of this oppertunity because of the supervision rule, parents from areas of deprivation find it more difficult to take thier children to these places because of other family commitments etc</li>
<li>Seemed more controlled before the Summer.</li>
<li>I come in from the country. It would help to be able to pre-discuss and maybe book extra help time.</li>
<li>Would love to go back regularly but Friday PM is not a good time for us.</li>
<li>Small groups are great but have you thought about informing schools about it? You might be able to help more kids. Maybe also ni4kids? Very difficult for parents to find out about technology related clubs for kids, found out through a colleagues husband. Thought the mentors were lovely &amp; understanding of my sons needs.</li>
<li>Just keep reminding me of events at Farset. I need to get more stuff into my calendar.</li>
<li>Instructors have become less helpful over time.</li>
<li>Some from of progression for the kids.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as we count down to our Steampunk-themed birthday party this weekend (<a href="http://fsl-industrial-revelations.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Tickets still available btw</a>), we were approached to host one of the more esoteric events of the calendar; a Steampunk LARP.</p>
<p>LARP stands for Live Action Role Playing, and can be summarised as a cross between a costume party and an immersive acting improvisation session, with a dash of D&amp;D thrown in, usually involving either historical, fantastical, or &#8216;alternate histories&#8217; scenarios playing out with a cast of costumed characters imagining themselves in the part.</p>
<p>So on September 28th, we&#8217;ll be playing host to&#8230;</p>
<h1><span style="font-family: georgia,serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oedUTOL.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" style="width: 400px; height: 280px; float: right;" alt="Belfast in 1880 with some modifications" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oedUTOL.jpg" /></a>Steel and Water</strong></span></span></h1>
<p>It&#8217;s 1882 and Belfast sits proudly as the de facto capital of The Federated Northern Isles. Its docks bustle with trade from Scandinavia, Russia, the Americas and North Africa and the populace thrives within the established social classes of Tin, Brass, Silver and Gold. Boasting the worlds first subterranean, submarine public transit system and home to some of the worlds grandest and finest engineering Belfast is the very model of a modern city. However, civilisation and endeavour always come at a price and must always face trials; alongside glorious and novel developments come novelties that are darker and less palatable.</p>
<p>Steel and Water is an immersion roleplay experience in which you become your steampunk persona and face the challenges of an advanced and alternative Belfast.</p>
<p>Booking coming soon, updates here and on Facebook.</p>
