<p>Greetings members&nbsp;and friends!<br />Time to hack together some comfort foods and share them with others!</p>



<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, and&nbsp;swapping stories of your 2018.<br />No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come with&nbsp;us&nbsp;so far.<br />There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorative&nbsp;decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />The date for this is Saturday 15th December, from 7pm to 10pm. We can carry on as we see fit!</p>



<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>



<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: Â£3)</p>



<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We will&nbsp;have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them and a little fridge space, however there is obviously very limited space for cooking on-site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good merry-tide once again, membersÂ and friends!<br />
The season of wintry victuals is upon us once more, so start with the heart of all things hacky!</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, andÂ swapping stories of your 2017.<br />
No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come withÂ usÂ so far.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorativeÂ decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />
The date for this is Saturday 9th December (at 7pm).</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
<p>We do ask that non-members of Farset contribute a small donation to the venue charity for the evening. (Suggested donation: Â£3)</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong><br />
Easy-to-share party foods, drinks, or tray-bakes are often the simplest, but if you have a speciality you want to share that&#8217;s even better! We willÂ have microwaves in the kitchen if you need them (the oven has gone to the great white-goods store in the sky&#8230;) however there is obviously limited space for cooking on-site.</p>

<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br />
Bring something tasty, or at least something edible, to Farset Labs for an evening of sharing food with good company, andÂ swapping stories of your 2016.<br />
No matter your connection, the evening is open and welcoming to all who have and will frequent Farset, and who have come withÂ usÂ so far.<br />
There will be some accompaniments of the musical variety, suitably decorativeÂ decorations, and waves of seasonal lighting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>The Date</strong><br />
The date for this is FridayÂ 2ndÂ December (at 7pm).</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong><br />
No cost other than your company and some form of shareable foodstuff or drinks (cold/hot, liquid/solid).</p>
