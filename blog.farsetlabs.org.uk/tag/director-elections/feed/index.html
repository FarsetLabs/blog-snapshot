<p>What is a hackerspace?</p>



<p>Scattered around the world each one is unique and means something different to each individual member.</p>



<p>In the autumn of 2015, I first visited Farset Labs and the very same week was my first as a member. It has been almost three years, yet I still find it hard to describe Farset. What about you?</p>



<p>One thing I know is that I have been to no other place like it. A place where anyone is welcome to experiment, teach, share ideas, unjustifiably set things on fire, watch opera and everything in between.</p>



<p>In Farset I met many people that I am glad to call friends. It is because of you that I discovered so many ideas and had the opportunity to realise new-found aspirations.</p>



<p>In Farset I met people with whom I share the principles of unbiased exchange of ideas and knowledge. Together we echo the same principles to our local communities in the form of clubs, meetups and mentorship of those on earlier stages of similar paths.</p>



<p>Each year I try to make a snowballing contribution to my community through building upon the experiences of years past.</p>



<p>&#8211; Helping at charity shops taught me the value of investing time<br />&#8211; Helping at Coder Dojo, Raspberry JAM and volunteering at events taught me the value of inspiring future successors<br />&#8211; Organizing my own kids&#8217; coding club with Code Club taught me the value of reaching out to communities outside our own<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing Code Co-Op and designing programming challenges taught me the value of peership and collaboration<br />&#8211; Co-Organizing NIDevConf18 taught me the value of bringing together people with differing perspectives<br />&#8211; Most importantly, joining Farset Labs taught me the value of community</p>



<p>Over the years of I have been delighted by the impact of these actions and privileged to have responsibility over them.</p>



<p>As a director, my goal would be simple &#8211; keep alive the light of our energetic environment and preserve the welcoming community I encountered three years ago. The areas I will invest most of my time in are:</p>



<p>&#8211; introducing a wider community of active individuals to our hackerspace<br />&#8211; providing opportunities to up and coming members of our community<br />&#8211; ensuring that the space remains genuinely useful to our evolving community<br />&#8211; lighten the burden of maintenance to allow more room for efforts in growth<br />&#8211; keep our management practices in touch with the community’s sentiments and beliefs<br /><br />Our local community is bustling with life and activity &#8211; let&#8217;s show them what a hackerspace can be.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Andy Sheppard</h3>



<p>Hello there! My name is Andy. I&#8217;m one of the founding members of Farset Labs, and I&#8217;m finally here to pitch in my nomination for directorship. My main reason is that I love Farset, and really want to see it grow. I have experience in leadership, and management and all those other boring things, but I also just really love to help people.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever spoken to me, you probably already know that, but maybe not! I do tend to ramble. In fact I&#8217;m rambling right now.</p>



<p>As I said, I just want to see the place grow, and thrive, and I feel that I&#8217;d be a good person to see that happen. Once I have something planned, I do my damned best to make sure that happens!</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t spoken to me before, I&#8217;d encourage you to do so! I love to hear stories of people&#8217;s experiences, and I also just really love to talk to people. But sure, let me know!</p>



<p>Much love, and all the best, </p>



<p>Andy S</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">RON</h3>



<p>Vote to reopen nominations if you are unsatisfied with the candidates offered and wish to have the nomination period reopened to new candidates. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Withdrawn: </strong>Zoe Gadon-Thompson (01/10/18)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three Directors back in late 2011/early 2012. We aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, and given that we&#8217;re currently below that magic prime number, it&#8217;s time to launch our 2018 Director Elections. Nominations for Directorship will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday 28th September</strong>.</span></p>
<p>The Directors of Farset Labs are the individuals expected to set the strategic direction of the charity, and have overall responsibility for maintaining the financial and legal health of the company. You will be expected to join the weekly management meetings and contribute in myriad other ways to the day-to-day running of the space; for example, fielding emails, authorising outgoing payments, and meeting with relevant parties, to name but a few.</p>
<p>You also get to steward a charity that does extensive youth outreach, makes opportunities available for the whole community, and hosts events that benefit all areas of the technology sector. We&#8217;re always trying to expand the remit of our offerings to serve even more people and it would be ideal for the incoming Director to aid in those efforts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nominees must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nominate themselves.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their name.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Monday 1st October</strong> (Conveniently coinciding with the next Town Hall) and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Monday 15th October</strong>.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/director-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections</a>, available on this blog.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Good luck!</span></p>

<p>When I hassled her for comment, this is what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheers to all who got involved in the recent election. I&#8217;m delighted to have been voted in, and am looking forward to getting my hands dirty to help keep Farset an excellent place.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can check out what Pip&#8217;s all about on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/" target="_blank">her website</a>.</p>
<p>PS The entire Farset Labs community would also like to congratulate Pip and her partner on their recently completed adoption, there are no two better people for it, and we wish you and your new family all the best!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/director-vote-2015/823">Voting is now open</a>; if you haven&#8217;t recieved an email and think you should have, or can&#8217;t access the poll, contact membership@farsetlabs.org.uk to double check your membership status.</strong></p>
<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pip Shea</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2613 size-medium" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg" alt="pip_s" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pip_s.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Farset Labs is extra_ordinary. It breaks the mould and defies the &#8216;wisdom&#8217; of incumbent structures through community building and collaboration. It offers an alternative for those of us who lurk in various guises on the creative technology spectrum: a place where we can practice, with autonomy, among an inspired and diverse community. I would like to become a director to help sustain this special space, and to contribute to its emergent practices and identity.</p>
<p>I have been a member since early 2014, and for the last couple of years I have been researching hacker/maker culture. I have a good understanding of the practices of Farset and how it is situated in a broader global context.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to offer my energy to the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>technology education and kids</li>
<li>measuring social impact</li>
<li>funding for social technology projects</li>
<li>participatory governance and ethics</li>
<li>membership drives</li>
<li>sharing Farset’s stories (its projects and practices) with the wider world</li>
<li>getting a laser cutter!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to become more involved in Farset Labs as I am passionate about grassroots making. During the 2000s &#8211; in Australia &#8211; I worked in <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/community-development/">community development</a> as an artist, producer, and manager on projects that focused on <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/networked/">net art</a>, aerosol art, and large-scale outdoor <a href="http://www.pipshea.net/projection/">projections</a>. In 2010, I turned my hand to research to investigate <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133">ethical internet practices in the community arts field</a>. I then worked as a research assistant at various universities in various incarnations. My research broadly explores digital cultures and philosophies of technology. I’m currently writing <a href="https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/PipShea">two book chapters</a> about maker culture, and assembling a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/crafting_making_hacking_research">hacking/making/crafting bibliography</a> on Zotero.</p>
<p>Other projects on the boil include: designing interactive tools with the QUB School of Psychology; editing an open access journal; and, making an art project that explores block chains and distributed databases through geometry. Ongoing interests include: <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Appropriate_technology">appropriate technology</a>, <a href="http://conceptlab.com/criticalmaking">critical making</a>, and <a href="http://www.foodphreaking.com/issue0pdf/Food_Phreaking.pdf">food phreaking</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><strong>Update:</strong> Due to several factors outside of our control, the directors have decided to postpone this series of elections until later in the year. Thanks!</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Farset Labs is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, starting with the original three directors back in late 2011/early 2012. Since then, we aim to try and keep the number of directors at five, so, with the recent departure of Ben Bland for warmer shores (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua">quite literally</a>), it&#8217;s time to launch our 2015 Director Elections. Nominations will open from the timestamp of this post until <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 18th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Nominees must:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2043" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fsl-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-main.jpg" alt="Democracy!" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<ul style="color: #222222;">
<li>Nominate themselves.</li>
<li>Have been a member for <strong>at least</strong> three months (not necessarily in one block).</li>
<li>Email david@farsetlabs.org.uk (and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) with
<ul>
<li>Their name.</li>
<li>Their ‘pitch’ which is 1000 characters maximum. (Suitability for role, experience, intentions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful in the elections, they must not have any convictions that would prevent them from being the Director of a limited company (i.e. convictions under the Fraud Act 2006) or any convictions regarding sexual offences against minors (i.e. convictions under the Sexual Offences Act 2003).</li>
<li>Be aware that they have legal obligations as a Director of Farset Labs, including their legal liabilities to HMRC etc.</li>
<li>Be aware that, if successful, they will be required to provide details including their legal name, sex, date of birth, addresses lived in the last three years, signature and National Insurance Number for the purposes of registration with Companies House.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #222222;">Voting will open when the nominee profiles (consisting of the nominee’s name and pitch) are posted publicly on <strong>Thursday 19th February</strong> and will close at <strong>midday</strong> on <strong>Friday 27th February</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Information on how to vote and the procedures surrounding voting, including the case of a draw, will be posted along with the nominee profiles. The results, barring any special circumstances, will be announced as soon as possible after voting closes, likely the following day.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Any questions can be directed to either <em>david@farsetlabs.org.uk</em> or <em>info@farsetlabs.org.uk</em>. You may also find it useful to review the records of previous elections, available on this blog.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time round that we opened the Director elections, we probably didn&#8217;t do it at a great time&#8230;exams, holidays and general tomfoolery were all ensuing. Consequently, we&#8217;d like to reopen them and give people a second chance to become a Director of Farset Labs.</p>
<p>Follow the guidelines from our previous post <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/director-elections/">here</a> and send your submission to david@farsetlabs.org.uk and CC admin@farsetlabs.org.uk as well.</p>
<p>Nominations are open from the timestamp of this post until midday on Thursday 13th June. Voting will then take place from when the nominee profiles are posted on Thursday 13th June until midday Saturday 23rd June.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>**UPDATE**: 21/6/13 (Bolster)</strong></p>
<p>In the light of the discussions held on the recently released <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/">Discourse</a>, and the fluffy date (Saturday 22nd or Sunday 23rd?) we&#8217;re extending voting through to <strong>5pm, Monday the 24th of June</strong>.</p>
<p>This will also tie in with the normally scheduled Director Meeting, that evening, and we will be inviting the two new directors to that meeting to discuss how to move forward.</p>
