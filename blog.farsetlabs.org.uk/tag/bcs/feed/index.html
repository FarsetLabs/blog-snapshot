<h5 class="wp-block-heading">If you can&#8217;t explain it to a six year old, you don&#8217;t understand it yourself. &#8211; Albert Einstein</h5>



<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a <strong>minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be running five sessions this year:</p>



<ul><li>12th September 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913730284?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913730284" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>14th November 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913731287?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913731287" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>9th January 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913732290?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913732290" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>13th March 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913733293?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913733293" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li><li>8th May 2019 &#8211; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/explain-like-im-5-201819-with-bcs-northern-ireland-tickets-48913734296?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=48913734296" alt="Eventbrite - Explain Like I'm 5 2018/19 With BCS Northern Ireland"/></a></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Theme:</h2>



<p>No themes this time, although if someone wants to suggest something crazy, get in touch!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Audience:</h2>



<p>The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. <strong>No topic is off limits</strong> as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to <strong>a lay audience</strong> within the constraints of the format.</p>



<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, hot food and fresh fruit intermission.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Rules:</h2>



<p>The rules for both groups are the same:</p>



<ul><li>Speakers have a maximum of <strong>7 minutes to speak</strong> on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li><li><strong>No Slides!</strong> The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li><li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to <strong>put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard</strong> along with their name.</li><li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!<br /></li></ul>



<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Explain Like I’m 5” is our collaborative speaker series, where local developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, artists, performers, scientists, and business people take a concept that may be highly specific to their area of expertise or work, and break it down to a lay audience from right across the STEAM spectrum with a minimal expectation of prior knowledge.</p>
<h2>The Time:</h2>
<p>Thursday 3rd March @ 1830 for a 1900 start</p>
<h2>The Place:</h2>
<p>Farset Labs, Event Space</p>
<h2>The Theme:</h2>
<p>This year we&#8217;re trying something a little different; the invited speakers all have something vaguely to do with a common theme. This time, the theme is <strong>&#8220;Connections&#8221;</strong>. Free-for-all speakers are welcome to either stick to the same thing or do something completely unconnected (see what we did there?)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have one of the <a href="http://www.brewbot.io/" target="_blank">BrewBot</a> folks talking about how their connecting their hardware to their customers (mostly talking about embedded electronics platforms and cloud stuff, funzies), an occupational therapist from the NHS who&#8217;s embarking on putting together a collection of modular, 3D printable end-point prosthetics for people who have lost extremities (fingers, etc rather than limbs) talking about how these are physically connected back to the patients and how the patients brains reconnect to accommodate the fake-finger.<br />
We&#8217;ll also have someone from <a href="https://www.tibus.com/" target="_blank">Tibus</a> talking about the fibre-heartland of Belfast, discussing the technological connections at various stages, from the network within Farset and the fibre infrastructure across the business park, to the transatlantic connections that power <a href="http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/business/investinginbelfast/superconnected-belfast/superconnected-vouchersscheme.aspx" target="_blank">superconnected</a>businesses. Also someone from <a href="http://www.younginfluencers.org/" target="_blank">Young Influencers</a> talking about the social connections within and between NI tech/dev/design communities and the future of this community.</p>
<h2>The Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.</p>
<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission.</p>
<h2>The Rules:</h2>
<p>The rules for both groups are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.</li>
<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name.</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!</li>
<li>Punishment for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the compère.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got something you’d like to share, sign up for the &#8220;Speaker&#8221; ticket type or email <a href="mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk">events@farsetlabs.org.uk</a> to discuss it with the subject line “ELI5”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long hiatus, Farset Labs is back with a new take on our hugely successful  <a title="Gathering of Lightning – 28/08/2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightning-28082014/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> ad-hoc presentation series, once again thanks to support from <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">BCS-Belfast Chapter</a>, with a few changes based on our experiences of running GoL over the past <a title="Event Calendar" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/event-calendar/" target="_blank">4 years</a>.</p>
<p>While feedback from the events was unanimously positive, it was felt that GoL was drifting away from it’s original intent to share experience, to educate, and to excite people both in and around the Farset community, with more product and sales pitches percolating up to speak than real knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>In an effort to take things back to their bare bones, we’re stealing some nomenclature from “The Front Page of the Internet”, <a href="http://www.shellypalmer.com/2013/2013/05/explain-like-im-five" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a>.</p>
<p>“Explain Like I’m 5”, and it’s abbreviation, “ELi5”, is a slang term used on the Internet in response to an overly complicated answer to a question that requires significant in-advance experience before it can be understood.</p>

Normal rules apply; Speakers have 7 minutes to talk about something they&#8217;re passionate about, with audience heckling encouraged, and the opportunity for a few more minutes of Q&amp;A after at the compères discretion. This time around, the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/clairedotw">Claire Wilgar </a>will be compère-ing (we expect Christmas Hats!) and for a change we have a rough idea of whose talking!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jiannhughes.com/" target="_blank">Jiann Hughes</a> will be talking about her work in the intersection between Art, Culture, and Technology</li>
<li>Colin Kelsey/Matt Hazely will be explaining some of the beer brewing techniques they are experimenting with in the labs</li>
<li>Will Burr from Billy Goat Entertainment will be demoing some of his currently-<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1236117571/her-majestys-spiffing" target="_blank">Kickstarting</a> game, Her Majesty&#8217;s Spiffing</li>
<li>Dr David Laverty, for Queen&#8217;s University Belfast&#8217;s Energy, Power and Intelligent Systems (EPIC) group, who are working on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/QUBEV" target="_blank"> converting a classic DeLorean to an Electric drive train</a></li>
<li>Sebastian Heinz from SARC will <strong>hopefully</strong> be demoing his wildly successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2012099678/patchblocks-programmable-mini-synth-modules" target="_blank">Patchblocks</a> project that has already obliterated its £10k funding goal</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll also <strong>hopefully</strong> have a visit from some developers from <a href="http://www.aepona.com" target="_blank">Aepona</a>, a locally based API-as-a-service company recently acquired by <a href="http://www.aepona.com/intel-and-aepona/" target="_blank">Intel</a></li>
<li>Finally, we&#8217;re <strong>hoping</strong> to get a short talk on some of the work done by PWC&#8217;s Belfast Based Digital Forensic Team</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we try to keep a few slots open for walk ins, so if you feel inspired to talk about something, let us know! Drinks and munchies are provided by the brilliant folks at the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/category/10444" target="_blank">British Computing Society</a>, who have supported us throughout our <a title="Gathering of Lightning" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gathering-of-lightening/" target="_blank">Gathering of Lightning</a> programme for the past year and a half.</p>

<li>On the night, presenters (planned or unplanned) are invited to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard</li>
<li>The Compère will decide what order in which presentations will be done, <strong>so be nice to him/her</strong></li>
