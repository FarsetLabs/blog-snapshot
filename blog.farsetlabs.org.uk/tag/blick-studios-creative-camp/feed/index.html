<p>This past month, we&#8217;ve been involved in <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/">DCAL&#8217;s</a> Creativity Month, in association with <a href="http://creativityni.org/">Creativity NI</a>.</p>
<p>This allowed us to experiment with ways to bring the general maker and creative community together, through our <a title="Makers’ Meetup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/makers-meetup/">Makers Meetup</a> programme (which we&#8217;ll be continuing as a basic social event), the <a title="Farset Bring &amp; Buy Sale" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-bring-buy-sale/">Bring and Buy sale</a> (that was decimated by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21955784">unprecedented weather</a>), and our upcoming <a title="DIY Guitar Pedal Workshop" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/diy-guitar-pedal-workshop/">DIY Guitar Pedal Workshop</a> (which still have spaces available if you order quickly! <strong><a href="http://www.maker.ie/farset-lab-fuzz-pedal-workshop.html">We have to close sales tomorrow</a></strong>!).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also been getting involved in other Creativity Month events; I went to <a href="http://www.blickstudios.org/">Blick Studios</a> <a href="http://www.creativecamp2013.com/">Creative Camp</a>. There was a fantastic array of speakers and activities (And Munchies!), and while I had to dart off soon after lunch (Due to our <a title="Club Mate Buy In" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/club-mate-buy-in/">Club Mate</a> arrival&#8230;), I was honoured to be speaking about our little lab.</p>
<p>As with most speaking events, the Q&amp;A is often more interesting than the speaking; one of the thrusts of my discussion was the siloed nature of Northern Ireland&#8217;s Creative and Technical Industries; Web Developers talk to Web Designers, Typographers talk to Graphic Artists, and Electronics-heads talk to Radio-heads, but rarely do these silos of talent and experience actually get pierced and mixed.</p>
<p>I suppose if there was an &#8216;aim&#8217; for Farset, from my perspective, it is to provide an even ground for these silos to interact on. Between our<a title="GOL4 – Back again" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/gol4-back-again/"> Gathering of Lightning</a> member-driven speaker series to our varied range of <a title="Global Game Jam Roundup" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-roundup/">hackathons</a>, we are trying to make people mix, because that&#8217;s where the best ideas come from; the intersection of two (or more) experience spaces.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1174" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1174" alt="Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP-225x3001.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1174" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical</figcaption></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s why I would implore you to get involved in what we&#8217;re trying to do. This isn&#8217;t about software or electronics or computers or gaming or whatever. This isn&#8217;t about making money; we&#8217;re all running on passion (and Caffeine!). This isn&#8217;t about stealing people&#8217;s ideas or scooping up equity. This isn&#8217;t about chasing funding at the expense of your ethics.</p>
<p>At its core it&#8217;s about sharing knowledge, experience, and inspiration across the full range of STEAM* areas for not just the &#8216;next generation&#8217; with our <a title="Coder Dojo @ Weavers Court" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/coder-dojo-weavers-court/">CoderDojo</a> and <a title="Outreach at Farset Labs" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/outreach-at-farset-labs/">Outreach</a> programmes, but also the current and past generations of industry leaders in the creative and technical arts.</p>
<p>Creativity Month was a risk for us to take on; we&#8217;re not an art house, we are a collective of the &#8220;Creative-Technically Minded&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t exactly make it easy to tick bureaucratic boxes and stay honest&#8230;</p>
<p>The act of creation and ideation is universal across art and science and engineering and business. Aspects from one area can complement and enhance others.</p>
<p>Only through mixing the melting pot of talent we have in this wee country do we have a hope of a prosperous, and happy, shared future. So please, get involved. <a title="Join Now" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Join the labs</a>, Come to an <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/org/2238451237?s=Style%20object">Event</a> or <a href="http://www.maker.ie/farset-lab-fuzz-pedal-workshop.html">Workshop</a>, or even just share this page to someone you think needs a bit of inspiration.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Science, Technology, Engineering/Entrepreneurship, Art and Mathematics</p>
