<p>As the nights close in during October, warm your creative engine with some tasty <a title="Global Game Jam 2014" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/global-game-jam-2014/" target="_blank">Game Jam</a> at Farset Labs. Our friends at <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> will be returning for a day-long game jam on <strong>Saturday 18th October</strong>, with a panel of independent game developers judging the winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/2014-belfast-gamecraft/">GameCraft</a> is a games jam event to build, bind and encourage the gaming community to make their ideas happen. This latest Belfast date forms part of a chain of GameCraft events starting back in 2012 with 120 people producing more than 35 games at the first event; since then it has been hosted in Belfast, Dublin, London, New York, and at huge national games events like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28923671">Insomnia</a>.</p>
<p>The jam is based on a secret theme, announced on the Saturday morning.</p>
<p>With that as your starting point, no matter your particular interests or skills, the task of making a game in a single day begins.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to a game jam before can tell you about the excitement of getting started, and the satisfaction of getting to the end &#8211; in between are the half-baked ideas that just about work, the quarter-baked short-cuts that work better than they deserve to, and the ages of concentration to get an animation right because it makes the character &#8220;just perfect&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fun ride, and GameCraft concentrates all of this into one day, so there&#8217;s none of the crazy-sleepless-zombie-coding seen at weekend jams.</p>
<p>Come to have fun! Come to share ideas or just compete! Most of all, come and make games!</p>
<p><strong>This is a BYOC event</strong>, but Farset can provide external monitors on request.</p>
