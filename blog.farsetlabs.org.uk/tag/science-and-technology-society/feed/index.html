<p>Things have been moving fairly quickly (compared to the normal speed of Northern Irish progress), but it&#8217;s about time we made a public update.</p>
<p>Due to the practicalities of developing something like this, a lot of the day-to-day development of Farset Labs has been done with little publicity. This was to maintain clear communication within the launch-community and worked really well in fleshing out the ideas for the space, the community, and the projects involved.</p>
<p>Special thanks must go to the members of Queen&#8217;s University Engineering, Science and Technology Society (<a title="QUESTS" href="http://quests.society.qub.ac.uk">QUESTS</a>) for letting Farset Labs fly under their wing initially, and to <a title="Ben Bland" href="http://unblanked.com/" target="_blank">Ben Bland</a>, <a title="Eoghan Murray" href="http://twitter.com/#!/eoghanmurray" target="_blank">Eoghan Murray</a>, <a title="Matt Campbell" href="http://twitter.com/#!/just__matt" target="_blank">Matt Campbell</a>, and <a title="David Kane" href="http://www.davidkanecreative.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Kane</a>, who between them have been instrumental in getting this far.</p>
<p>Even beyond the &#8216;regular&#8217; group, there&#8217;s been a large amount of input from the community at large, through our <a title="Farset Labs Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">IdeaScale</a>, where you can vote on and submit ideas for the space, on everything from equipment purchasing to governance strategies.<span id="more-62"></span></p>
<h1>What&#8217;s been happening?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chicken-egg1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-70" title="chicken-egg" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chicken-egg-300x3001.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>A significant amount of time was spent endeavouring to get local tech-business sponsorship for start-up<br />
costs and initial rental fees, but this quickly degraded into a multi-way chicken-and-egg scenario where potential sponsors wanted more plans in their preferential areas before they could commit, and we couldn&#8217;t commit since, frankly, none of us have the time or the money to mount a full-scale business proposal for something that is perfect for boot-strapping.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my <em>personal</em> belief that once we boot-strap ourselves into existence, corporate sponsors will come running to get involved in what will be the centre of the tech community in Belfast. For more info on the &#8216;Vision&#8217; for Farset Labs, see <a title="Farset Labs Vision Statement" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/farset-labs-vision-statement/">here</a>.</p>
<h1>So how far are we anyway?</h1>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl id="attachment_63" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 435px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=209132938352510964233.0004bb8402d1ebf03db91&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;ll=54.595589,-5.934334&amp;spn=0.017404,0.036478&amp;z=14&amp;output=embed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="350"></iframe>Those are some pretty transportation links!</dt>

<p>Well we&#8217;re currently in final-stage negotiations with ex-Lord Mayor of Belfast, Tom Ekin, of <a title="Weavers Court Business Park" href="http://www.weaverscourt.com/" target="_blank">Weavers Court Business Park</a>, Just off Sandy Row in Belfast.</p>
<p>Weavers Court is a controlled industrial estate 3 minutes walk from Great Victoria Street Station, 15 minutes walk from Belfast City Centre, and 20 minutes walk  from UU York Street building and QUB Ashby Building.</p>
<p>Additionally, plenty of free car-parking spaces, an on site Cafe, and a whopping <a title="10gB Tibus Fibre Line" href="http://www.tibusconnect.com/about/news/item/14/super-speed-business-park-is-first-in-europe/" target="_blank">10Gb Tibus Fibre-line connection</a> with direct peering to the Hibernia Atlantic via Project Kelvin in Coleraine, giving <a title="Hibernia Atlantic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic" target="_blank">&lt;60ms latency to the Eastern Seaboard</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it a perfect location not only for the kind of technical experiments we plan on doing, but also for community outreach within both the local south-Belfast area, but also the entirety of Northern Ireland, being just two hours by train from Londonderry.</p>
<p>[fsg_gallery id=&#8221;1&#8243;]</p>
<p><strong>All being well, and pending review of the rental agreement with some associates, we should be moving in within the fortnight.</strong></p>
<h1>So What Can We Do?</h1>
<p>The space is more or less sorted, but it&#8217;s empty. We need your help to fill it while we wait for membership cashflow to buy more equipment.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard hackerspace stuff (check out the <a title="Hackerspace Electronics Lab" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Electronics_Lab" target="_blank">hackerspaces.org</a> page for examples),</li>
<li>general network and power infrastructure equipment,</li>
<li>DIY Tools and Materials,</li>
<li>Electronics tools</li>
<li>Embedded controllers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, mBed, PICAXE, etc)</li>
<li>Computers (any condition; dead ones will be turned into decorations; extremely old ones will  be turned into museum pieces)</li>
<li>Interesting tech-hardware (No, a printer doesn&#8217;t count, unless its a dot matrix <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/e189493b036abc631c15614a44070ed1.png" target="_blank">in which case&#8230;</a>)</li>
<li>Art/Decoration supplies, Paint, Brushes, rollers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything you can give, we&#8217;ll make it up to you when we get the Karma system up and running (blog post incoming about that; exciting times!)</p>
<p>The donation form should be embedded below, but some browsers have trouble with it so here&#8217;s <a title="The Great Farset Labs Donation Form" href="https://docs.google.com/a/andrewbolster.info/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDJRanJpZTlPTW9VN3VLbWtWRllibGc6MQ" target="_blank">the link</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dDJRanJpZTlPTW9VN3VLbWtWRllibGc6MQ" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="760" height="960"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ever, even if you can&#8217;t contribute any hardware to the community, please contribute your time and ideas to the <a title="Farset Labs Ideascale" href="http://farsetlabs.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">Farset Labs Ideascale</a></p>
