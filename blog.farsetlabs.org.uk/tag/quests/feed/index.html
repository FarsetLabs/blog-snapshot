Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; Farset Labs has several ages&#8230;<span id="more-396"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>3 weeks since our first big event (<a title="SpringUp: Launching Five Startups in 28 Hours" href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/springup-launching-five-startups-in-28-hours/">SpringUp</a>)</li>
<li>3 weeks and 1 day since we got heating</li>
<li>1 month in the building (officially)</li>
<li>36 days in the building from first &#8216;preparation&#8217;</li>
<li>2 months since first discussions with Weavers Court</li>
<li>3 months since registration with companies house / HMRC</li>
<li>6 months since the property hunt went into full swing (cheers to Eoghan, David, and Conor; a cracking property-survey team)</li>
<li>7 months of operating with the name &#8216;Farset Labs&#8217;</li>
<li>10 months of running hackathon events with <a href="http://quests.qub.ac.uk">QUESTS</a> and QUB <a href="http://www.dragonslayers.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dragonslayers</a></li>
<li>12 months since founding QUESTS</li>
<li>19 months of regular &#8216;Pub&#8217; meetings with the local tech community, spawning off some great projects and ideas along the way.</li>
<li>21 months since I came back from America full of energy and optimism</li>
<li>21 months and 19 days since I wrote the first entry on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/belfast-hackspace-working-group/KJw3A8uAdXA" target="_blank">Belfast Hackerspace Working Group</a>, lying in a hammock at the Pennsylvania Hotel, NY, at <a href="http://thenexthope.org/" target="_blank">TheNextHope</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#8217;ve done brilliantly. I want to personally thank everyone who has been involved in this effort over all this time and hope that we&#8217;ll continue to make this even more awesome than it already is.</p>
<p>Coming up is what looks to become our flagship regular event; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340108216053357/" target="_blank">FlackNite</a>; an intensive &#8216;lock-in&#8217; (no, we won&#8217;t lock you in) where members, old and new, can come and work on their projects and showcase them to their peers. We&#8217;re working to get some &#8216;VIP&#8217;s over, but mum&#8217;s the word on that for the time being. Since we&#8217;re making this up as we go along, we welcome any and all advice/ideas/insults as to how we&#8217;re doing things.</p>
<p>Work progresses on the CCTV and Access Control (RFID) system, and the User Management System (tasty tasty karma) is under-way. Hopefully the directors will be able to stop working at some point and start doing our own projects, but not yet! We&#8217;re doing this for you!</p>
<p>So, tell your friends, tell your family, tell your boss, tell your colleagues, tell your lecturer, tell your classmates,</p>
<p>Farset Labs is here to stay.</p>
