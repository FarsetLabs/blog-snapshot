<p>And boy was it a wild afternoon.<span id="more-602"></span></p>
<p>Tech Camp were introduced to us several months ago by our good friend, <a title="The Man, The Legend" href="https://twitter.com/robelkin">Rob Elkin</a> (who&#8217;s currently sunning himself on the west coast, lucky duck). We scheduled a day where the kids would come in and explore, and it was almost immediately forgotten about. Then I get an email during the week from the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/ruthebabes">Ruth Elkin</a> reminding me of what I&#8217;d let Farset Labs in for.</p>
<p>[fsg_gallery id=&#8221;3&#8243;]</p>
<p>The Level of excitement from these kids was amazing. I was expecting a flying visit with a load of bored quiet students who&#8217;d be afraid to ask questions. Not so <del>lucky</del>!</p>
<p>Seeing these teens brought back just a little bit of faith that given a few years, we can turn this province into a real innovation engine, driven by the passion for STEM and &#8216;Tinkering&#8217; that I saw, and one of the kids (epically) found one of our broken Nerf guns, asked<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/farset_labs/7780628090/in/pool-1894295@N24/lightbox/"> if he could fix it</a> (yes, we scoffed), and then, ten minutes later, shot me in the face. Legen&#8212;dary.<br />
Oh, and they pretty much destroyed our blackboard. Check out the timelapse below. I wish I had a dust mask on when I eventually wiped it down.</p>

<p>The Nerf Gun battles were Epic in their destruction, The Buzz around our Raspberry Pi&#8217;s was intense for kids who had never heard of linux before in some cases. The Fascination with our Robotic Arm (which ended up with a laser pen mounted on it</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a stranger guys! And watch this space! We&#8217;ve got a few U18 events in the pipeline (if we can keep the Insurers on side!)</p>
