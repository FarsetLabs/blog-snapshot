<p>TL;DR If there&#8217;s something that you think needs fixed/changed in Farset Labs, go to our somebody-should <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">Github Repo</a> and raise an issue.</p>



<p>Over the past 7 years, we&#8217;ve had Trello, Google Tasks, Asana, Trello Again, JIRA, Trello again and finally JIRA, as issue-management and tracking systems. All have had loads of bells and whistles and integrations and tracking workflows, and hardly any got used by the general membership to raise issues that were affecting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was living in Liverpool, I joined <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">DoESLivepool</a>. They have a very simple system that feeds in to not only their weeknotes bot, but also their machine booking and repair tracking system; a github repo that only stores issues, called <a href="https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should">somebody-should.</a></p>



<p>So, for the past month, we&#8217;ve been quietly switched over, referring people who raise issues in the Slack to raise an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/FarsetLabs/somebody-should">repo</a>, populating and processing a few sample issues, experimenting with milestones, and generally faffing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we&#8217;re &#8220;officially&#8221; announcing it. We&#8217;re still fiddling with some of the documentation, but as they say, no good plan survives contact with reality, so go raise some hell(ish issues).&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has accomplished a lot in the past <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/01/what-is-farset-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 years</a>, stimulated by the goodwill of the STEAM community, and underpinned by the direct financial support of the membership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like many others in the community and voluntary sector, we face continually rising overheads despite efficiently delivering our charitable aims. As such, we’re exploring a new revenue stream: <strong>in-space advertising</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, we will be putting up four A3 poster panels in the co-working space and workshop on a three-month trial basis, available on rolling monthly hire by outside organisations and companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These poster locations will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis at the discretion of the Farset Labs management team, and posters must be provided by the advertiser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are currently priced as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community/charitable/non-profit groups advertising events, programmes &amp; opportunities: £150pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct advertisement of goods, services &amp; jobs: £300pm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indirect promotion of recruitment services &amp; non-specific roles: £600pm</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d be interested in participating in this trial, contact us on <a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk">info@farsetlabs.org.uk.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of this three month period, the results and impact will be assessed openly in the community along with trial participants, and any modifications deemed necessary will be made before restarting the programme. Trial participants will have early-access into the continued programme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new revenue stream will give Farset Labs a more stable platform from which we can cover our increasing operational costs and focus on reinvesting in our services and facilities. We want to achieve this without having to put any more financial pressure on the members of our community who need access to these resources the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farset Labs has been a fully membership-funded community space, delivering volunteer-driven <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2017/01/farset-dojo-2017-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outreach</a>, <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/free-workshop-for-secondary-teachers-introduction-to-bbc-microbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a>, and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/launching-makerassemblyni-16th-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facilitation</a> to the STEAM community; from programming &amp; engineering courses at local primary and secondary schools, to taking part in national and global collaborative events such as <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/12/global-game-jam-2017-20th-22nd-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Game Jam</a> and <a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2016/02/bbcmakeitdigital-connected-home-roadshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC’s Make It Digital </a>campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, we have been a melting pot for meetups and user-groups, with our <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/events/how-to-start-a-class">free use of our event space on Wednesday evenings</a> for qualifying non-profit groups and individuals, where organisers can test the viability of their event ideas, developing communities that can (and usually do) rapidly grow to join the major meetup circuit beyond Farset Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the nature of the community fostered under our roof, Farset Labs has also hosted and spun-through a number of successful member-run startups, giving entrepreneurs the freedom to explore, collaborate, and experiment without losing equity or requiring significant upfront costs (<a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/">Desk rental</a> starts at £100 per month, but <a href="http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/hotdesk/">hot desking</a> is included at all membership levels).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this while operating on what can only be described as a &#8220;lean&#8221; budget. With no staff, no salaries, and no institutional funding, we have kept our significant outgoings limited to rent, power, heating (most of the time), cleaning and refuse collection, and insurance/accounting/<a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/2012/11/farset-labs-legal-encounter/">legal</a> fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, your company or your organisation wish to support the work of Farset Labs, or are interested in engaging with this unique community, get in touch via email to </span><a href="mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@farsetlabs.org.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tweet us at <a href="https://twitter.com/farsetlabs">@FarsetLabs.</a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last month&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1mkKslw4NRc6fuDuJJmS7c6Qse5NQaW9ubi-zJeH-un4/edit">Town Hall</a>, our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/farsetlabs.org.uk/document/d/1HbHBnNlmMUmnpVYyMqmkJtKF7ktULBL1QI8eWkGUk9k/edit#heading=h.ddez2tcjct2z">proposal</a> for the creation of a Non-Executive Manager (NEM) role within Farset was ratified unanimously by the community, and as such has been added to the <a href="http://beta.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/ops_manual.html">Operations Manual</a> (that link may break in the next few weeks, please let us know if we don&#8217;t notice it!).</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>NEMs are mini-directors with responsibility of awareness in limited fields, eg Projects, Digital Infrastructure, Events, Facilities</li>
<li>Not legally liable to the company</li>
<li>Looking for volunteers; one role (Digital Infrastructure) already selected.</li>
<li>If interested, email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday from 8pm free.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-1629"></span><a href="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1630" alt="dilbert-random-acts-of-management" src="https://blog.farsetlabs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dilbert-random-acts-of-management1.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>The Long Version</h1>
<p>So, what does that mean? First a short history lesson; as it stands, Farset is &#8216;run&#8217; by the directors i.e. the four people who are legally responsible for the company. However, we&#8217;ve also been implicitly in charge of the day-to-day operation of the space, which is a significant workload for four busy volunteers to do alone, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say we haven&#8217;t been perfect.</p>
<p>For us to keep awareness of the increasing amount of activity in the space, we felt it was necessary to add a sort of interface layer between the day-to-day operation of the space and the membership, and the directors&#8217; strategic and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>As such, NEMs are members, selected by the Directors, to be single points of contact for a range of fields in the space. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re expected to do all the work in those fields, instead they are a person of responsibility with no legal tie to the company other than membership. When selected they will be publicly listed and any new or existing members can direct questions in their fields directly to them instead of what happens at the minute; an email goes to admin, we scratch our heads wondering what&#8217;s happened in that area in the past week, ask who we think would know and eventually get back with a &#8216;contact this person&#8217; email&#8230;</p>
<p>Expected workload is low, most of the time. It&#8217;s up to each NEM to work out how much work they want to do and where they want their boundaries of responsibility to end, and even the definitions of the fields are flexible at this point. Since this is the first time we&#8217;ve done this as an organisation, it&#8217;s still fluffy. In order to nail it all down, we&#8217;d like to bring the interested parties together to hash out how  it would actually work. The relatively simple-to-delineate one (Digital Infrastructure) has already been selected (No one will be surprised to hear that it&#8217;s Dan Porter) but the others are wide open.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, read the proposal document and the ops manual, and if you&#8217;re not scared off, drop us an email on admin@farsetlabs.org.uk and keep next Monday (14th) from 8pm free for a chat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this <a href="http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/nems-call-for-volunteers/338">Discourse thread</a> is the best place to publicly comment and discuss the idea.</p>
