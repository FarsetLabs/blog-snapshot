Terry,

Unfortunately this was last year. This year we haven&#039;t been able to resource the time to set up another summer school, as we&#039;ve been working on our wider Raspberry Jam programmes.

As always, Farset is self funded and run our members in their free time, so we have to prioritise our activities based on available resources and time. If you&#039;d like to support and direct our activities, please consider becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/membership/index.html#friend-of-farset&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Friend of Farset&lt;/a&gt;

All the best!

Bolster]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have two kids aged 9 and 12 that would be interested in attending your coding course you mention, what dates and times are available, and would there be a cost involved? They could both bring a device say an ipad and a laptop. Would an adult be required to stay for the duration of the course?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.

Regards Terry.]]></description>
