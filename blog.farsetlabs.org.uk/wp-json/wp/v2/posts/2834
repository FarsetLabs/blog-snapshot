As discussed on <a href=\"http:\/\/slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk\/\">Slack<\/a>, the <strong>Workshop Clearout<\/strong> will be taking place this weekend (<strong>Saturday 3rd and Sunday 4th December<\/strong>). Any help is appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Member equipment that is in member project boxes will, of course, remain untouched, as will any clearly labelled equipment as per the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.farsetlabs.org.uk\/about\/rules_and_policies.html\">member handbook<\/a>. If you have left any kit in a position that may have, shall we say, not quite complied with the rules, please give us a shout on <a href=\"mailto:info@farsetlabs.org.uk\">info@farsetlabs.org.uk<\/a>\u00a0to make sure we know about it and that it&#8217;s not disposed of. Any queries, as always, can also be directed to that address.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be relocating a few pieces of equipment to more suitable homes within the workshop and this should make using the space a lot easier for all. Naturally, this means that the workshop can&#8217;t be used for any member projects during the clear-out and we apologise for the disruption.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see what&#8217;s planned (particularly disposal of equipment believed to be communal and unwanted), check out the barebones plan available <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1h3twkWYZtflMa_pxFwoiaan-P59qOIg9Ut5HdLnO7rY\/edit?usp=sharing\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>(The rather lovely featured image is by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pagedooley\/3121844717\/\">Kevin Dooley<\/a>.)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>December is nearly upon us and with it comes a raft of Farset events!
