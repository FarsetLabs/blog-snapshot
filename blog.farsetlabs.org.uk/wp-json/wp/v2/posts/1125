With mentors (and kids) hopefully coming from all over the park and from the community of Sandy Row, we think that this will be a great addition to our <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk\/index.php?title=Outreach_Projects\">growing outreach activities<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be running the Dojo on the First and Third Thursday&#8217;s of the month (we know this makes for a strange end-of-May, but it&#8217;s the lesser of two evils&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/coderdojo.com\/\">CoderDojo<\/a> is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.<\/p>\n<p>At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they\u2019ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.<\/p>\n<p>CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: \u201cAbove All: Be Cool\u201c, bullying, lying, wasting people\u2019s time and so on is uncool.<\/p>\n<p>It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don&#8217;t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/event\/5770231919?ref=ebtn\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/custombutton?eid=5770231919\" alt=\"Eventbrite - Weavers Court CoderDojo\" width=\"158\" height=\"36\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more information about Coder Dojo, check out the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/coderdojo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">CoderDojo global webpage<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Also check out our <a title=\"Weavers Court Dojo on Zen\" href=\"http:\/\/zen.coderdojo.com\/dojo\/279\" target=\"_blank\">Dojo Page on Zen<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ee;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>FAQs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there an age limit to enter the event?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/coderdojo.com\/\">CoderDojo<\/a> is aimed\u00a0loosely\u00a0at the under 18&#8217;s, but any child younger than 14\u00a0<strong>must<\/strong>\u00a0be accompanied by a parent or guardian<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are my transport\/parking options getting to the event?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is\u00a0available\u00a0all across the Weavers Court Campus<\/p>\n<p><strong>What should I bring to the event?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have the\u00a0resources\u00a0available\u00a0to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop\/tablet\/smartphone, that&#8217;d be great.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I can&#8217;t make it, what can I do to help?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at BMC in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/zen.coderdojo.com\/dojo\/110\" target=\"_blank\">Belfast<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/zen.coderdojo.com\/dojo\/274\" target=\"_blank\">Ballymena<\/a>, or the brand new Dojo in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/zen.coderdojo.com\/dojo\/45\" target=\"_blank\">Newry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UPDATE: This post is now very old and is possibly out of date, see here for the latest CoderDojo Updates &nbsp; Farset Labs is playing host to the Weavers Court CoderDojo, kicking things off with a &#8216;soft launch&#8217; next Thursday the 21st from 17:30-20:00.
