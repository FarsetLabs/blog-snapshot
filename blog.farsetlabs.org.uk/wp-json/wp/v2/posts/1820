In the years since formation, Farset has grown.<\/p>\n<p>We have grown in numbers, in experience, and in maturity.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been a paying member of Farset since day one, and was a member of QUESTS (The Queen\u2019s Society that worked together to set Farset up) even before that. You can see me in the old photos from the days of our scouting out buildings to rent!<\/p>\n<p>Alongside Farset and QUESTS, I founded the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/QUBARES\">QUB Amateur Radio &amp; Electronics Society<\/a>, through which I teach amateur radio courses with the Radio Society of Great Britain.<\/p>\n<p>Having just completed an industrial placement year with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andor.com\/\">Andor Technology<\/a>, I\u2019ve gained invaluable real-life experience in industry.<\/p>\n<p>I feel that the director\u2019s role in Farset is to facilitate the members\u2019 needs. To provide the resources required for members to achieve what they want to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>As such, I intend to keep Farset involved in education schemes and programmes, so that we can have a tangible and measurable impact on our membership and our community. I would like to see Farset expand in the area of electronic hardware design, and would intend to promote that area to the director group, and to the membership at large.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s keep growing.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Conor is an active contributor to the IRL Farset Community, as well as the <a href=\"http:\/\/discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk\/t\/director-elections-2014\/543\/4\">Discourse<\/a>, where you can ask him any questions either privately via his <a href=\"http:\/\/discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk\/users\/conor\/activity\">profile<\/a>\u00a0or in the open by\u00a0summoning him from the ether with &#8220;@Conor&#8221;.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0RON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1825\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large-300x1981.jpg\" alt=\"chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>ReOpen Nominations<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ron does nothing, and means we open up nominations again and lose an active director when Ben leaves next month.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The Directors assert\u00a0that this\u00a0election, odd as it is, satisfy the Director Appointment Rules as set up in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.farsetlabs.org.uk\/about\/ops_manual.html\">Operations Manual<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FarsetLabs\/farsetlabs.github.io\/commit\/c5abb01213e2b017e1dd606e0b6f2c99de567994\">ratified<\/a> by Town Hall Consent from March this year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our nomination period is up and voting will open shortly (emails will be sent to all current members eligible to vote) and in the meantime, you can peruse your options below, consisting of the nominee name and pitch: 1.
