Photos, videos and measurements will be taken on the journey, and for the next few weeks it&#8217;s open season on any crazy stunts people want the craft to perform while it&#8217;s up there. &#8220;There&#8221; being SPACE.<\/p>\n<p>This kind of thing has been done before, typically using a smartphone for GPS and GoPro for video, so we&#8217;re going to have to make use of the Pi&#8217;s computing power to do something unique.

So we&#8217;ve proposed a challenge that needs the collaboration of loads of people from different backgrounds \u2013 electronics, mechanics, software, communications, legal &amp; admin, all sorts. It&#8217;s something everyone could contribute to.<\/p>\n<p>We met yesterday to assign teams to cover each of the main disciplines that will be required (Mechanical,\u00a0Electrical,\u00a0Management, and\u00a0Marketing\/PR). The teams are seeking help, not just from Farset Labs members but anyone who is keen to support the project. Details such as the launch date and the craft&#8217;s functions are open for discussion for the time-being and all ideas are welcome, within reason. Already some suggestions have been assigned to the bin, mostly because they&#8217;ve involved live animals or explosives \u2013 or both.<\/p>\n<p>Notes from the first meeting are in GDocs, <a title=\"Farset Labs SpacePi First Meeting\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1wd7pbxAEwfdytjUinWikYlAZJ0Pe2CIjYuxnOnYsXbw\/edit\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.
