On the first Saturday of each month, we&#8217;re going to hold a series of lightning talks, where anyone with an interest or passion about or around tech can do a bit of a rant. Very informal, and very relaxed athmosphere. If you want to submit a talk, just add it to the wiki page!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>FEAST\/FAMINE<\/strong> is an obscure abbreviation that one of the directors came up with that is a informal takeaway\/pizza night every first Sunday of the month for members.

Once I learn the darned acronym, I&#8217;ll let you know.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Legitimate Business<\/strong> is a series of commercial,\u00a0corporate, governmental\u00a0and entrepreneurial best practise events held on the second Tuesday of each month, including guest speakers from the local (and hopefully,\u00a0international) business and entrepreneurial community.

We&#8217;re hoping to put on some commercially sponsored data-challenges and competitions to make things interesting.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And to close off the week, we&#8217;re holding a Belfast <strong>HacksHackers<\/strong> chapter on the fourth Saturday of the month. \u00a0It\u2019s for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And that&#8217;s our month! Most of these events are still in the &#8216;ironing out&#8217; stages, and we&#8217;re open to offers of corporate sponsorship for individual events to offset any catering costs, but hopefully this gives Farset a bit more consistent structure. <strong>Our first event of this new and improved events schedule will be the Open Data Playground on the 28th of June. <\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If you&#8217;ve been tickled by any of these events, don&#8217;t hesitate to get involved in the wiki pages linked above!
