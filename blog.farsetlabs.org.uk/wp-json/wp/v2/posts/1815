A few ideas I&#8217;ve had looking at global open data reactions (feel free to steal, just buy me a pint if you win):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking of public transport routes against traffic cam statistics to highlight inefficient commuter routes or routes that need outer-city park&#8217;n&#8217;rides<\/li>\n<li>Interactive timelapse explorer for census data dating back as far as we can, able to explore the changes in income, occupation, living standards, and social mobility over time.<\/li>\n<li>Collation of constituency candidate voting data against ministerial\u00a0voting activity (i.e. vote as I say not as I vote)<\/li>\n<li>Real Estate Cross-referencing system based on personal priorities (I care this much about public transport, and this much about free parking)<\/li>\n<li>Collation of birth\/death rate statistics against ministerial healthcare investment per postcode\/county area<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Last Bus\/Train&#8221; alarm so you can get a last pint in.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To be honest and personal, only reason I&#8217;m <strong>not<\/strong> going for it is that I can&#8217;t be at the pitch event at CultureTECH.
