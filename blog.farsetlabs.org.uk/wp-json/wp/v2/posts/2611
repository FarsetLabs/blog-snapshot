It breaks the mould and defies the &#8216;wisdom&#8217; of incumbent structures through community building and collaboration. It offers an alternative for those of us who lurk in various guises on the creative technology spectrum: a place where we can practice, with autonomy, among an inspired and diverse community. I would like to become a director to help sustain this special space, and to contribute to its emergent practices and identity.<\/p>\n<p>I have been a member since early 2014, and for the last couple of years I have been researching hacker\/maker culture. I have a good understanding of the practices of Farset and how it is situated in a broader global context.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, I would like to offer my energy to the following areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>technology education and kids<\/li>\n<li>measuring social impact<\/li>\n<li>funding for social technology projects<\/li>\n<li>participatory governance and ethics<\/li>\n<li>membership drives<\/li>\n<li>sharing Farset\u2019s stories (its projects and practices) with the wider world<\/li>\n<li>getting a laser cutter!!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I want to become more involved in Farset Labs as I am passionate about grassroots making. During the 2000s &#8211; in Australia &#8211; I worked in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipshea.net\/community-development\/\">community development<\/a> as an artist, producer, and manager on projects that focused on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipshea.net\/networked\/\">net art<\/a>, aerosol art, and large-scale outdoor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipshea.net\/projection\/\">projections<\/a>. In 2010, I turned my hand to research to investigate <a href=\"http:\/\/eprints.qut.edu.au\/73133\">ethical internet practices in the community arts field<\/a>. I then worked as a research assistant at various universities in various incarnations. My research broadly explores digital cultures and philosophies of technology. I\u2019m currently writing <a href=\"https:\/\/independentresearcher.academia.edu\/PipShea\">two book chapters<\/a> about maker culture, and assembling a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zotero.org\/groups\/crafting_making_hacking_research\">hacking\/making\/crafting bibliography<\/a> on Zotero.<\/p>\n<p>Other projects on the boil include: designing interactive tools with the QUB School of Psychology; editing an open access journal; and, making an art project that explores block chains and distributed databases through geometry. Ongoing interests include: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appropedia.org\/Appropriate_technology\">appropriate technology<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/conceptlab.com\/criticalmaking\">critical making<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodphreaking.com\/issue0pdf\/Food_Phreaking.pdf\">food phreaking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel you need a little more info about me, it can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipshea.net\">pipshea.net<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cheers!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0RON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1825\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large-300x1981.jpg\" alt=\"chicken-cute-eat-food-harry-potter-Favim.com-136639_large\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>ReOpen Nominations<\/p>\n<p>Ron does nothing, and means we open up nominations again.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The Directors assert\u00a0that this\u00a0election, odd as it is, satisfy the Director Appointment Rules as set up in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.farsetlabs.org.uk\/about\/ops_manual.html\">Operations Manual<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FarsetLabs\/farsetlabs.github.io\/commit\/c5abb01213e2b017e1dd606e0b6f2c99de567994\">ratified<\/a> by Town Hall Consent from March 2014.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UPDATE: Voting is now open; if you haven&#8217;t recieved an email and think you should have, or can&#8217;t access the poll, contact membership@farsetlabs.org.uk to double check your membership status.
