I say &#8216;involvement&#8217; &#8211; it was really just supportive conversations, but once established this quickly turned into an obligation to join, and a membership fee has been ripped bodily from my strained bank account ever since.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not all bad&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the things I love about Farset Labs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The slight tendency towards anarchy<\/li>\n<li>The attempts at real democracy<\/li>\n<li>The diversity of people + their abilities<\/li>\n<li>The sense of community and random connections<\/li>\n<li>The stuff all over the place<\/li>\n<li>All the code &#8216;n shit with the young people \u2018n all<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I love the sense of &#8216;if it ain&#8217;t broke, break it&#8217; &#8211; (though not Robin Prices&#8217;s lighting-up ping-pong table, nor Matt Hazley&#8217;s beer-making kit, &#8216;cos the phrase &#8216;don&#8217;t break stuff that makes beer&#8217; should need no explanation)<\/p>\n<p>Currently I&#8217;m CTO\/co-founder of Sixty-5 Technologies &#8211; Farset&#8217;s co-working space was where we spent a lot of last year. Bolster was instrumental in John Arrell &amp; I getting together, David Kane helped with initial specs, Robin Price worked on our Gateway box, Mal Duffin seriously improved our UI, Art Knipe straightened up our API &#8211; all invaluable &amp; there&#8217;s nowhere else in NI where that could happen.<\/p>\n<p>As well as techie stuff I&#8217;ve done sales &amp; marketing, management &amp; director stuff &#8211; so I can bring wide experience with an anarchic twist.<\/p>\n<p>Right now I&#8217;m doing a lot of coding (at 57, I know, God help us) &#8211; most of the Sixty-5 Android code &amp; some of the Ruby on Rails cloud stuff is mine. Also devops stuff with servers and all that kind of thing. I love all the hands-on stuff.<\/p>\n<p>So, for Farset, as well as sharing the organisational burden with the others, there are a bunch of things that interest me:<\/p>\n<p>Connectivity between the diverse membership and the wider community &#8211; both social and industrial. There&#8217;s all sorts of interesting stuff that Farset members could be part of, if it interests them. Let&#8217;s find more of these things.<\/p>\n<p>Learning &#8211; there are so many different ways to get engaged in tech &amp; to learn without going through the established education routes (with their gatekeepers). Some of that Farset is already doing well. I love the idea of someone coming through Farset from no tech knowledge to paid work. Or just for fun.<\/p>\n<p>Farset has a lot of potential to act as an incubator for early stage startups &#8211; there&#8217;s already a bunch of that happening right now (Sixty-5 is but one example)<\/p>\n<p>Diversity &#8211; I love diversity &amp; inclusion. We can extend what we already have.<\/p>\n<p>I love people poking at projects &#8211; how can we do more of this?<\/p>\n<p>I love the idea that in years to come, world-changing stuff or people might have had their roots in Farset.
