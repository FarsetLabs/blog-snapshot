For a while, we&#8217;ve been playing with the idea of getting rid of the suspended fibre ceiling in the space and exposing the period pillars and beams, and after a day&#8217;s experimentation, it&#8217;s decided: we&#8217;re going ahead!<\/p>\n<p>What the vision entails is exposing the entirety of the building&#8217;s original woodwork and support pillars, and restoring them to their former glory. New architectural lighting, black ceiling beams and renovated cable management are all in the master plan, as well as some lovely aesthetic improvements like stripping the cast iron pillars to the bare metal.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/2012-06-12-13.28.031.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-538\" style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px 6px;\" title=\"2012-06-12 13.28.03\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/2012-06-12-13.28.03-150x1501.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>However, we&#8217;ll need some assistance.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We currently do not have many sets of <strong>ladders<\/strong> which are a crucial part of the project.
