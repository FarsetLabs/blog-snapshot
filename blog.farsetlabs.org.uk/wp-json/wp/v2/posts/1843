This latest Belfast date\u00a0forms part of a chain of GameCraft events starting back in 2012 with 120 people producing more than 35 games at the first event; since then it has been hosted in Belfast, Dublin, London, New York, and at huge national games events like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-28923671\">Insomnia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The jam\u00a0is based on a secret theme, announced on the Saturday morning.<\/p>\n<p>With that as your starting point, no matter your particular interests or skills, the task of making\u00a0a game in a single day begins.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has been to a game jam before can tell you about the excitement of getting started, and the satisfaction of getting to the end &#8211; in between are the half-baked ideas that just about work, the quarter-baked short-cuts that work better than they deserve to, and the ages of concentration\u00a0to get\u00a0an animation right because it makes the character &#8220;just perfect&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fun ride, and GameCraft concentrates all of this into one day, so there&#8217;s none of the crazy-sleepless-zombie-coding seen\u00a0at weekend jams.<\/p>\n<p>Come to have fun! Come to share ideas or just compete! Most of all, come and make games!<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is a BYOC event<\/strong>, but Farset can provide external monitors on request.<\/p>\n<p>You can find more information about GameCraft, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamecraft.it\/events\/2014-belfast-gamecraft\/\">register for GameCraft Belfast, on their site<\/a>. <strong>Registration is required<\/strong> to take part.<\/p>\n<p>Farset Labs Members can also take advantage of their <strong>free tickets<\/strong>.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk\/t\/free-members-tickets-for-gamecraft\/556\" target=\"_blank\">Information on how to get your free tickets in our members forum<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"\/\/eventbrite.ie\/tickets-external?eid=12654956315&amp;ref=etckt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"214\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"5\" marginheight=\"5\" scrolling=\"auto\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Belfast GameCraft is sponsored by DemonWare, SixMinute, and Leman Solicitors, and is hosted by Farset Labs<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the nights close in during October, warm your creative engine with some tasty Game Jam at Farset Labs.
