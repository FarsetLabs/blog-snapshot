You don&#8217;t need to consider yourself a designer or maker to get value out of the day.

During the workshop we&#8217;ll talk about what\u00a0prototyping\u00a0involves, and look at the recent revolution in rapid prototyping, assisted by technologies like 3D printers and the internet.\u00a0Then we&#8217;ll stop talking and play \u2013 making\u00a0simple prototypes with paper and pen and whatever we have to hand.<\/p>\n<p>You can come to all or just part of the day&#8217;s events. Or just meet us in the pub in the evening. Mmm beer. There&#8217;s no charge but please register\u00a0if you&#8217;re coming so we know the numbers. And we&#8217;re\u00a0seeking\u00a0techie, creative and communicative people to be in the room to help\u00a0facilitate\u00a0progress\u00a0\u2013 please <a href=\"mailto:ben.m.bland@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">contact me<\/a>\u00a0if you can help.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re calling it FailFast to resurrect an old project that never got much momentum. I guess you could say it failed, rather fast. But that&#8217;s the whole point. There&#8217;s a\u00a0popular sentiment in the entrepreneurial world that failure is a big part of innovation and creativity. So much so that it\u00a0has become trendy.\u00a0Most ideas don&#8217;t grow into anything substantial. Most startups collapse. The important thing is to try \u2013 develop your idea, get your prototype out into the world, see if it works and iterate on its development, and do so as quickly and cheaply as possible. It will probably fail so if you want something to succeed, fail fast, fail cheap and fail often. So yeh, we&#8217;re calling it FailFast.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and it rhymes with Belfast. Sort of.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fail fast, fail cheap. Or is it &#8220;fail fast, fail often&#8221;?
