Pitch Per Square Foot.<\/p>\n<p>We have approx 30 square meters of blackboard. About 322 sqft in old money. We guestimate that about 250 of that is usable by the average human.<\/p>\n<p>Each attendee has a little over a square foot to describe themselves, make an impact, and leave enough contact details to be got in touch with.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-640\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"gilchrist2\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/gilchrist2-300x168.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/gilchrist2-1024x575.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>That\u2019s the gimmick.

Going over the lines will be punished by having your square wiped out and given to someone else.
