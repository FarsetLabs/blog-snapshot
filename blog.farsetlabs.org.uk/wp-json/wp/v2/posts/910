In respect to the latter, one of the most impressive projects on show was the use of a Pi to control an <a href=\"http:\/\/mindstorms.lego.com\/en-gb\/default.aspx?icmp=COUKFR26MINDSTORMS\" target=\"_blank\">NXT robotics system<\/a>; this was from a (impressively uniformed, for 7pm) sixth form student from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dalriadaschool.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dalriada School<\/a>, giving weight to the hopes of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/about\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi Foundation<\/a> that their innovation will ignite the passion for tinkering and technology in schools. Of course, not only is the Pi a wonderful development system, it can also run a variety of more consumer oriented tasks; if loaded up with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raspbmc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">RaspBMC<\/a> software, you now have an immensely capable <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxuser.co.uk\/features\/raspberry-pi-media-centre-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a325 media centre<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/IMG_3403-Medium1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-912 alignright\" title=\"IMG_3403 (Medium)\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/IMG_3403-Medium-300x2001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>After the scheduled session, the assembled users had the chance to mix, compare experiences and work collaboratively, demoing, among others, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/phpBB3\/viewtopic.php?f=78&amp;t=18853\" target=\"_blank\">Quake 3 running on the Pi<\/a> and a system for the Pi built entirely from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uk.freecycle.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Freecycle<\/a>, including a hacked screen from an in-car entertainment system and a jury-rigged powered USB hub with connections to a keyboard, mouse and wireless card.<\/p>\n<p>Future sessions intend to cover alternative distributions (operating systems for the Raspberry Pi), strange use cases and hardware interfacing, both via direct link and also the <a href=\"https:\/\/projects.drogon.net\/raspberry-pi\/gertboard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gertboard<\/a>.
