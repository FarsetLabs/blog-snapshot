This was, after some discussion and deliberation around which desks should be on\/off limits for renting, ratified unanimously.<\/p>\n<p>As part of a similar &#8220;Huh, I thought we had that?&#8221; discussion, we realised we didn&#8217;t explicitly state any limits on hazardous chemical handling.
