Welcome to the family!<\/p>\n<p>Intel hopes that supporting Farset Labs will help to build close relationships with the local technology community and open opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. Similarly, we&#8217;re keen to act as a link between the industrial sector and our member-base of makers and technology geeks. Partnering with a company that is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s leaders in innovation is a big occasion for us.<\/p>\n<p>Corporate membership allows some of Intel\u2019s staff to use the hackerspace, for working on technical projects, mixing and collaborating with individual members, and hosting events. There is a successful history of companies integrating with, and providing staff access to, external technology workshops in other countries. In the US particularly, new products and companies have been launched from ideas developed in hackerspaces there, and partnering companies have reported major increases in innovation metrics such as the filing of new patents.<\/p>\n<p>Since Intel acquired the Belfast-headquartered software company Aepona in April 2013, the company has been seeking to enrich its affiliation with external technology workers and graduates. Joining Farset Labs is a public commitment to this cause. Michael Black, General Manager Intel Belfast said \u201cIntel strongly believes in the importance of supporting technology and innovation, and there is already lots of discussion and excitement from individuals who are keen to share knowledge with the Farset community and to work together with them to turn ideas into prototypes and products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There have never before been better prospects for anyone with the courage to be innovative and entrepreneurial. Intel has a rare history of repeated success through innovation. Having Intel as our new corporate member gives all our members an opportunity for hands-on access to the company\u2019s extraordinary drive, expertise and resources.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re in discussion with Intel over plans for events and projects throughout 2014.
