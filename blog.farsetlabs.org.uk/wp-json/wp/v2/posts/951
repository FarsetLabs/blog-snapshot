Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today\u2019s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games \u2013 it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games\u2026 while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don\u2019t code can contribute to a game.<\/p>\n<p>This is going to be an in-demand event so please register attendance beforehand!<\/p>\n<p>Note that <strong>Donations are not required for this event<\/strong> as refreshment costs are covered by <a href=\"http:\/\/oi.ulster.ac.uk\/\">UUOI<\/a>, but donation tickets will go directly into the general Farset fund, for which we&#8217;ll be paying the bills to keep Farset going day-to-day!<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/event\/5189530024?ref=ebtn\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Eventbrite - Flacknite - GlobalGameJam 2013\" src=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/custombutton?eid=5189530024\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h1>Raspberry Jam: Sat 9th Feb<a href=\"http:\/\/fsl-pijam-0213.eventbrite.com\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-960\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-960\" alt=\"logo\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/logo-150x1501.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/h1>\n<p>After the success of our last jam, and already falling behind our schedule due to a)Christmas and b) Exams, we&#8217;re finally bringing it back to life!<\/p>\n<p>Raspberry Jam is a Farset Labs Members event, so visitors are expected to make a small donation either in the form of an online ticket, or chucking a few coins in the tin in person.<\/p>\n<div><strong>You do not need to have a Raspberry Pi<\/strong>\u00a0to come to a meeting.
