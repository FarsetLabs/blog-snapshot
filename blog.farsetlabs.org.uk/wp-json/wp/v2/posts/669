This both helps students and those of low income by significantly cutting the costs of membership, and provides a bed for more wealthy people to get access to more expensive features at a very low price compared to for-profit ventures.<\/p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Current Model<\/h1>\n<p>As all members will be aware, the current model of membership operates at a fixed amount payable each month, with a \u00a35 discount for people with valid student cards at recognised academic institutions. At this time, the membership fee is \u00a330 per month, making it \u00a325 per month for students.<\/p>\n<h1>Reasons for the change<\/h1>\n<p>A lot of people have approached Farset Labs with the intention of joining, only to be discouraged from signing up due to the relatively high costs involved. This is most noticeable in students and those with lower incomes. These are precisely the kind of people Farset Labs needs to be vibrant, so we need to tailor to them first. Similarly, more professional members have expressed a wish for more business-like features and high-end features, which will be made available at a premium.<\/p>\n<p>These changes were discussed at the<a title=\"Town Hall Meeting and The Gilchrist &amp; Co 5th Anniversary Event\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/town-hall-meeting-and-the-gilchrist-co-5th-anniversary-event\/\"> Town Hall<\/a> meeting this month and the community who attended accepted the plan.<\/p>\n<h2>Current Limitations<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the listed advantages (specifically the job board and Asterisk-based phone systems) are not\u00a0available\u00a0yet, but we&#8217;re pushing these\u00a0administrative\u00a0changes for new members out as quickly as possible to give Freshers coming to the Belfast area to study, and recent grads coming to work here, an even greater incentive to join the community.<\/p>\n<h1>Roles<\/h1>\n<p>The membership model will now be modelled with four distinct levels, each with different levels of access and varying features, and a proportionate price to match. These roles will cover from basic student membership up to \u201chonorary\u201d membership for those who wish to financially support Farset Labs or with to provide extra monetary help on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a title=\"Membership\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/membership\/\">Membership<\/a> page has been updated to reflect a summary of these roles<\/p>\n<h2>Student Membership<\/h2>\n<p>Student membership for Farset Labs will be priced at \u00a315 per month and is available to all members with a valid student card at a recognised academic institution, and those attending a recognised school.<\/p>\n<p>This level of membership offers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to the space while it is open, but not 24-hour access#;<\/li>\n<li>Use of all equipment and tools in the space;<\/li>\n<li>Access to the Internet and public network resources using both WiFi and the wired network;<\/li>\n<li>Access to all events organised by Farset Labs;<\/li>\n<li>The ability to use the event space and other rooms for meetings if they are free at the time;<\/li>\n<li>Voting rights at Town Hall meetings and in all community polls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Enthusiast Membership<\/h2>\n<p>Enthusiast membership is priced at \u00a325 per month and is aimed at hobbyists and enthusiasts, as well as students who want a higher level of access, particularly when it comes to online resources and access to the space 24\/7.
