They were there to show off and to consult our community about the recently released <a title=\"NIA Open Data\" href=\"http:\/\/data.niassembly.gov.uk\/\">NIAssembly Open Data<\/a>\u00a0API. (They also have a fantastic <a href=\"http:\/\/m.niassembly.gov.uk\/\">mobile<\/a> webapp btw)<\/p>\n<p>First off, I&#8217;ll personally say that compared to the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk<\/a>, the NIA API is much cleaner and easier to use quickly (We&#8217;re slowly putting together a Python module to make life even easier).<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the data\u00a0available\u00a0at the minute, they have <a href=\"http:\/\/data.niassembly.gov.uk\/members.asmx\">Member<\/a> information going back to &#8217;98, (i.e. who was in each Assembly, who were they representing, etc), <a href=\"http:\/\/data.niassembly.gov.uk\/questions.asmx\">Question\/Answers<\/a> put to the Assembly floor since around &#8217;07 \u00a0(including text-search), and another data set of <a href=\"http:\/\/data.niassembly.gov.uk\/organisations.asmx\">Organisations<\/a>, listing Departments, Committees, Political Parties, and All Party Groups.<\/p>\n<p>While all this information is well and good, the major points that came out of the round-table discussion were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/data.niassembly.gov.uk\/license.aspx\">Licence<\/a> under which these datasets are exposed is perfectly relaxed, and is a model that further public and indeed private bodies should emulate (i.e. do whatever you want, make as much money as you like, it&#8217;s all yours, just do us a favour; if it&#8217;s convenient, give us a solid attribution)<\/li>\n<li>The Datasets are still growing; Michael aim&#8217;s to have information on votes cast exposed by Q4, and more datasets are being developed, but that political inertia was slowing the adoption of similar practices across other departments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>The conversation expanded away from just NIA&#8217;s data to the concept of Open Data itself. Emphasis was made that the best <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/magazine\/archive\/2012\/08\/features\/the-exabyte-revolution?page=all\">Data Scientists<\/a>, and the best <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/open-platform\">Data<\/a>, source from multiple boring silos and synthesise exciting or intriguing information across those silos.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>It is not the place of the resource generator to cherry-pick what they think is interesting.<\/em><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The follow on topic of debate was centred around the required skills. Willis McGregor from SkillSet made the point that there is both a combination of technical and non-technical skills needed at both the data curation and the data analysis ends, and neither area is well catered for at the minute from anything other than &#8216;on the job&#8217; learning.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The skills discussed centred around, for the curation side, an almost &#8216;librarian\u00a0attitude&#8217;, to both the raw data itself and the architecture of that data. On the other side of the data divide (the consumers\/analysts), a strong combination of statistics, programming, and a certain amount of, as William Cully described, &#8216;childlike enquiry&#8217;, to explore and recognise areas where correlated datasets don&#8217;t match where they should. The act of analysis was discussed as being a compromise between the standard journalistic &#8216;hunt for bad anamolies&#8217; (the example given was financial transactions, *<a href=\"http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/opinion\/news-analysis\/ulster-banks-future-is-hanging-in-the-balance-16183521.html\">cough<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-18671255\">cough<\/a>*, but also an interest in finding unexpected correlations between datasets.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The discussion naturally cycled back to NIA, via Healthcare data. The observation was made that the current data policies of the healthcare establishment in Northern Ireland mean that data is not even compatible between<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dhsspsni.gov.uk\/index\/dhssps_links.htm#hssni\" target=\"_blank\"> local trusts<\/a>, and developing a common open-data standard would require major\u00a0political\u00a0force and justification, but Caroline suggested that new legislation coming through the European and Westminster governments would require just actions to be enforced.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking back out at other datasets, there was some discussion about what data the BBC could provide and what interesting stuff could be done with it, such as crowd sourced archive classification, combined with already implemented voice recognition metadata generation.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">All in all it was a very interesting and active event, that settled into several hours of post-officialdom-networking with <del>several<\/del> a few beers and snacks. Everyone is very much looking forward to the next Open Data Playground, where we&#8217;ll hopefully be presenting a roundup of tools that make exploring open data easier, such as <a title=\"APIgee\" href=\"http:\/\/apigee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">APIgee<\/a>, <a title=\"Recline\" href=\"http:\/\/okfnlabs.org\/recline\/\" target=\"_blank\">Recline<\/a>, and <a title=\"Python Data Analysis Library\" href=\"http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pandas<\/a>.

If you decide to talk about<br \/>\nsomething, there&#8217;s space for you to do so, and plenty of people who want<br \/>\nto listen.<\/p>\n<p>The campsite will be littered with interesting things to play with and<br \/>\nexplore, from ride-on tanks to giant dinosaurs. And more lasers than you<br \/>\ncan shake a laser-covered stick at.<\/p>\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to form villages and put on activities for<br \/>\nother people around the camp, and we&#8217;re going to have villages covering<br \/>\neverything from gaming to 3D printing. If you&#8217;d like to form a village,<br \/>\nget in touch!<\/p>\n<p>Because EMF is an event all about learning things and meeting new people<br \/>\nwe really want to get as many hackerspace members along as possible, so<br \/>\nfor the next two weeks we&#8217;re offering a discount off the full ticket<br \/>\nprice.<\/p>\n<p>The following link will grant a discount to anyone who clicks it for the<br \/>\nnext two weeks.
