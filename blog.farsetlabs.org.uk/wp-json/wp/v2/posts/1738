No, wait, not quite volunteers: in fact all of us pay to be members in the first place. So if you or your contacts are interested in sponsoring great causes like our CoderDojo events, or getting behind Farset in its mission to develop everyone&#8217;s creative and technical skills, get in touch. And you don&#8217;t have to be a deep-pocketed company, Farset&#8217;s lifeblood is our recurring monthly member payments, and we are always keen for small personal donations from visitors to the Labs. &#8216;Nuff said about filthy lucre, now let&#8217;s get back to the&#8230; errr&#8230; ROBOTS!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/FL_DjSummer\">Register for the CoderDojo Summer Course here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><i>P.S: No nasty remarks about my design skills on the flyer.
