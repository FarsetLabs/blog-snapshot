You\u2019ll be given the weekend to work on an idea you\u2019d like to kick-start, taking advantage of a community\u2019s knowledge sharing, as well as equipment and resources provided by Farset. And of course, there will be plenty of food and caffeine in supply to keep your energy levels up throughout the weekend!<\/p>\n<p>To get a feel for how we run hackathons, have a look at some of our previous ones! <a title=\"Global Game Jam Roundup\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/global-game-jam-roundup\/\">Global Game Jam<\/a> was extra special, but our usual <a title=\"New Year Lightning \u2013 Flacknite \u2013 Raspberry Jam\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/new-year-lightning-flacknite-raspberry-jam\/\">Flacknites<\/a> are a good demo of the &#8216;hands off&#8217; approach we take.<\/p>\n<p>This year the hackathon has the feel-good theme of \u201c<strong>Making a Difference in the Community<\/strong>\u201d, so chosen ideas should ultimately be for a good cause and benefit the local community in some way. That coupled with the chance to win a <strong>prize fund of up to \u00a31000<\/strong> for the most innovative ideas; there are no better reasons to sign up!<\/p>\n<p><em>Please note: Neither Farset Labs nor event sponsors, Liberty IT, will <strong>make<\/strong> any claim on intellectual property generated at the event.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To sign up, either complete the form below or visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/lit-hackathon.eventbrite.co.uk\">https:\/\/lit-hackathon.eventbrite.co.uk<\/a><\/p>\n<p>* 12pm Saturday until 6pm Sunday<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; text-align: left;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\/tickets-external?eid=9009277993&amp;ref=etckt&amp;v=2\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"5\" marginheight=\"5\" scrolling=\"auto\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; padding: 5px 0 5px; margin: 2px; width: 100%; text-align: left;\"><a style=\"color: #ddd; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\/r\/etckt\" target=\"_blank\">Event Registration Online<\/a><span style=\"color: #ddd;\"> for <\/span><a style=\"color: #ddd; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/lit-hackathon.eventbrite.co.uk\/?ref=etckt\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty IT Innovation Hackathon<\/a> <span style=\"color: #ddd;\">powered by<\/span> <a style=\"color: #ddd; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.co.uk?ref=etckt\" target=\"_blank\">Eventbrite<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are pleased to announce that Farset Labs will be hosting a hackathon on the weekend of the 7th and 8th of December*.
