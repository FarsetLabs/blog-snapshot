The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves learning and expanding their horizons. No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format. The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission. The rules for both groups are the same: Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A. No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations. Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name. The Comp\u00e8re will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him\/her! Punishment for rule\/time violators is at the discretion of the comp\u00e8re.
