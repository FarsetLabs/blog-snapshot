Anything, everything, we need your advice!<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I think this is a great opportunity for young people to learn the language and skills associated with computer programming that can only help them in the future, although i fear some children under 14 will not be able to avil of this oppertunity because of the supervision rule, parents from areas of deprivation find it more difficult to take thier children to these places because of other family commitments etc<\/li>\n<li>Seemed more controlled before the Summer.<\/li>\n<li>I come in from the country. It would help to be able to pre-discuss and maybe book extra help time.<\/li>\n<li>Would love to go back regularly but Friday PM is not a good time for us.<\/li>\n<li>Small groups are great but have you thought about informing schools about it? You might be able to help more kids. Maybe also ni4kids? Very difficult for parents to find out about technology related clubs for kids, found out through a colleagues husband. Thought the mentors were lovely &amp; understanding of my sons needs.<\/li>\n<li>Just keep reminding me of events at Farset. I need to get more stuff into my calendar.<\/li>\n<li>Instructors have become less helpful over time.<\/li>\n<li>Some from of progression for the kids.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few weeks ago we sent out survey requests to anyone who&#8217;d attended (and registered) to our CoderDojo programme since day one.
