No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.<\/p>\n<p>The event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by an <strong>intermission with drinks and a selection of Japanese food<\/strong> (just to shake things up!). There will be ample time to have a chat with all the other good folks who come down.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>The Rules:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The rules for both groups are the same:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&amp;A.<\/li>\n<li>No Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations. <strong>The blackboard is your friend.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Before the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name.<\/li>\n<li>The Comp\u00e8re will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him\/her!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve got something you\u2019d like to share to the audience, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk\">events@farsetlabs.org.uk<\/a>\u00a0to discuss it with the subject line \u201cELI5\u201d.
