There was a fantastic array of speakers and activities (And Munchies!), and while I had to dart off soon after lunch (Due to our <a title=\"Club Mate Buy In\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/club-mate-buy-in\/\">Club Mate<\/a> arrival&#8230;), I was honoured to be speaking about our little lab.<\/p>\n<p>As with most speaking events, the Q&amp;A is often more interesting than the speaking; one of the thrusts of my discussion was the siloed nature of Northern\u00a0Ireland&#8217;s\u00a0Creative and Technical Industries; Web Developers talk to Web Designers, Typographers talk to Graphic Artists, and Electronics-heads talk to Radio-heads, but rarely do these silos of talent and experience actually get pierced and mixed.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose if there was an &#8216;aim&#8217; for Farset, from my perspective, it is to provide an even ground for these silos to interact on. Between our<a title=\"GOL4 \u2013 Back again\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/gol4-back-again\/\"> Gathering of Lightning<\/a> member-driven speaker series to our varied range of <a title=\"Global Game Jam Roundup\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/global-game-jam-roundup\/\">hackathons<\/a>, we are trying to make people mix, because that&#8217;s where the best ideas come from; the intersection of two (or more) experience spaces.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1174\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1174\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1174\" alt=\"Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/BGcd1EdCQAA5kgP-225x3001.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Bolster, waxing lyrical<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I would implore you to get involved in what we&#8217;re trying to do. This isn&#8217;t about software or electronics or computers or gaming or whatever. This isn&#8217;t about making money; we&#8217;re all running on passion (and Caffeine!). This isn&#8217;t about stealing people&#8217;s ideas or scooping up equity. This isn&#8217;t about chasing funding at the expense of your ethics.<\/p>\n<p>At its core it&#8217;s about sharing knowledge, experience, and inspiration across the full range of STEAM* areas for not just the &#8216;next generation&#8217; with our <a title=\"Coder Dojo @ Weavers Court\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/coder-dojo-weavers-court\/\">CoderDojo<\/a>\u00a0and <a title=\"Outreach at Farset Labs\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.farsetlabs.org.uk\/outreach-at-farset-labs\/\">Outreach<\/a> programmes, but also the current and past generations of industry leaders in the creative and technical arts.<\/p>\n<p>Creativity Month was a risk for us to take on; we&#8217;re not an art house, we are a collective of the &#8220;Creative-Technically Minded&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t exactly make it easy to tick bureaucratic boxes and stay honest&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The act of creation and ideation is universal across art and science and engineering and business.
